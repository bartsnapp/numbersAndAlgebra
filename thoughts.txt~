Thoughts for new:

TN = Teacher Notes

Connecting bases to place value - see Beckmann 4-8.

Activity: Lies my calculator told me. EG from 107 

--We need to add 3.12.2, and 3.12.10, to 108

TN: 1.2.2 Cube

TN: 2.1 division thm - give examples of discussion for uniquenss etc

TN: 2.1 Marching Band question needs explaining - at the end of the
day, you end up facing different directions--one great thing about
this problem is that it is really really complex--and it is done the
way it is done in schools!

A: We need several models for multiplying... checks and
bills... perhaps simply a hw too.

TN: Importantce 2.2: Understand 3(x+y) = 3x+3y.

A: explains *why* the euclidean algorithm works.

TN: 3.3 DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SIMPLIFY--if the students are unhappy, this
fine, the mathematician's were unhappy too.

TN: 3.3 complex means in the form a+bi

Roots of unity... do we want to get into this? We totally could with the semester conversion...

TN: Louie Llama has a secret objective--plot stuff.

TN: 4.1.8 is a problem that must be done.

A: Socks and drawer 108 talk to Herb, We can do A LOT more with the binomial thm. 

A: Mod m and base m.

A: Finding inverse mod m.

TN: A.8 - releveant hw problems. (For all activities!!!)

A.10 -> fix tree diagram... 

A.12: Write story problems for fractions....

A.12 - 105 question - voters county a, voters county b etc. See Beckmann hw/activity.

TN: A.22 not a rigours argument - just trying to give intution and make them work with complex numbers. 

A.24 -- too hard probably should be removed!

A.?? Base 13 word problem. Bakers Dozen. Then add, then multiply.




































Jokes:

I will stop at NOTHING, to avoid using negative numbers!


I'm sorry, the number you have dialed is an imaginary number. Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and dial again.



The Flood is over and the ark has landed. Noah lets all the animals
out and says, "Go forth and multiply."

A few months later, Noah decides to take a stroll and see how the
animals are doing. Everywhere he looks he finds baby animals. Everyone
is doing fine except for one pair of little snakes. "What's the
problem?" says Noah.  "Cut down sssome treesss and let usss live there", say
the snakes.

Noah follows their advice. Several more weeks pass. Noah checks on the
snakes again. Lots of little snakes, everybody is happy. Noah asks,
"Want to tell me how the trees helped?"

"SSSertainly", say the snakes. "We're addersss, ssso we need logsss to
multiply."




1.3.2 (Continuted Fractions) Could be replaced with:


We could have a section called: "Meanings of Fractions" where we present different "meanings" of fractions. For each given meaning, we would then challenge the student to justify various arithmetical procedures via that given meaning.

Heck - one of our "meanings" could be that a/b is a number such that the denominator is never zero and

a/b = c/d exactly when ad = bc.

At the end we could have some sort of open-ended discussion about the pros and cons of various meanings.


On a slight side note - I don't really like talking about "the meaning of fractions" I prefer "meanings of fractions" or maybe even "contextualization(s) of fractions" or maybe "contexts of fractions"


Possible different contexts in no particular order
*) Number line
*) Picture
*) Formal
*) Percent
*) Ratio or Proportion (Are those different?)
*) Others???

Each subsection of this section could be called: "A (blank) context for fractions" 

In the beginning of the section we would descibe the meaning of the fraction in the given context. 

Next we could give an example of a single justification of some arithmetical proceedure - maybe a different one for each context. 

Next we could present a confound for the method--maybe?

Finally we would have the exercises. 


Continued fractons could be put back in in the "Real Numbers section"
Perhaps even numerically..... (i.e. calculator based!)

As I made my way home, I thought Jem and I would get grown but there
wasn't much else left for us to learn, except possibly algebra.

What is a number - largest number smallest number

setting Pi to be 3.14 - what is an irrational number


An irrational number... it is the thing that the pi needs to approach
as circles get larger and larger...


Long division via pictures!




The problem with the carafs is fantastic.
- they supply the examples
- they must draw pictures of fractions.
- they must use high school algebra.


Word problems without numbers?????

Factor: 111,1234, 2345, 3456, 4567, 111111,99999999999

Tartaglia (1556) claimed that the sums 1+2+4, 1+2+4+8, 1+2+4+8+16, ...
are alternately prime and composite. Is he right? Explain your
reasoning.

DeBouvelles (1509) claimed that one or both of $6n-1$ and $6n+1$ are
primes for all $n\ge 1$. Is he right? Explain your reasoning.


Explain why if n is composite, then $2^n -1$ is composite. 

Is it possible for a prime to divide both $n$ and $n+1$ when $n\ge 1$?
