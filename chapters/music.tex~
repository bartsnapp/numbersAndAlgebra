\section{Clocks}

It is now time to think about clocks. Consider the usual run-of-the-mill clock:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/clock.pdf}
\]
\begin{ques}
Suppose you start grading papers at $3$ o'clock and then $5$ hours
pass. What time is it? Now suppose that you find more papers to grade,
and $5$ more hours pass---now what time is it? How do you do these
problems? Why are there so many papers to grade?
\end{ques}
\QM

We have a mathematical way of writing these questions:
\begin{align*}
3 + 5 &\equiv 8 \pmod{12} \\
8 + 5 &\equiv 1 \pmod{12} 
\end{align*}
We call arithmetic on clocks \textbf{modular arithmetic}.
\index{modular arithmetic} Being rather fearless in our quest for
knowledge, we aren't content to stick with $12$ hour clocks:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/moreclocks.pdf}
\]

\begin{ques}
Suppose you are working on a $2$ hour clock:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/twoclock.pdf}
\]
Suppose you started at time zero, and finished after 10245
hours. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Where is the hand of the clock pointing? 
\item How does the answer change if you are working on a $5$ hour
  clock?
\item What if you are working on a $7$ hour clock?
\end{enumerate}
\end{ques}
\QM




OK---clocks are great. Here is something slightly different: Denote
the set of all integers that are $r$ away from a multiple of $5$ by
$[r]_5$. So for example:
\[
[0]_5 = \{\dots,-15,-10,-5,0,5,10,15,\dots\}
\]
Write down the following sets:
\begin{align*}
[1]_5 &=  \raisebox{-3mm}{\fbox{\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}\hspace{50ex}}} \\
[2]_5 &=  \raisebox{-3mm}{\fbox{\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}\hspace{50ex}}} \\
[3]_5 &=  \raisebox{-3mm}{\fbox{\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}\hspace{50ex}}} \\
[4]_5 &=  \raisebox{-3mm}{\fbox{\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}\hspace{50ex}}} \\
[5]_5 &=  \raisebox{-3mm}{\fbox{\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}\hspace{50ex}}} 
\end{align*}

\begin{ques} With our work above, see if you can answer the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why one could say that $[4]_5 = [9]_5$.
\item Explain why one could say that $[2]_5 = [-3]_5$.
\item Explain what you think is meant by the expression:
\[
[1]_5 + [2]_5 = [3]_5
\]
\item Explain what you think is meant by the expression:
\[
[1]_5 + [4]_5 = [0]_5
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{ques}
\QM



\begin{ques}
How many interpretations of modular arithmetic can you give?
\end{ques}
\QM

OK---I know I was supposed to leave that question for you, but there
is one interpretation that I just gotta tell you about---check this out:
\[
a \equiv b \pmod{m} \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad a - b = m\cdot q
\]

\begin{ques} What is the deal with the junk above? How does it help you solve congruences like
\[
3x \equiv 1 \pmod{11}?
\]
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques}
Is it the case that 
\[
5+x \equiv 2 + x \pmod{3}
\]
for all integers $x$? Why or why not? Use each of the interpertations
of modular arithemetic above to answer this question.
\end{ques}

\section{In the Real World}

Perhaps the coolest thing about mathematics is that you can actually
solve ``real world'' problems. Let's stroll through some of these
``real world'' problems.

\subsection{Automotive Repair}

\subsubsection{A Geometry Problem}

One Thanksgiving Day I had a neat conversation with my cousin Chris at
the dinner table. You see he works on cars---specifically vintage
Italian sports cars. He had been doing some routine maintenance on one
of his cars and needed to remove the steering wheel and the steering
column.  All was fine until it came time to put the parts back
together. The steering wheel was no longer centered! The car could
drive down the street just fine, but when the car drove straight ahead
the steering wheel was off by a rotation of 5 degrees to the
right. This would not do!  This sounds like a geometry problem.


\subsubsection{An Algebra Problem}

How did this happen you ask?  Well the
\index{steering!wheel}\textit{steering wheel} attaches to the car via
the \index{steering!column}\textit{steering column}:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/wheelcolumn.pdf}
\]
there were $21$ notches on the back of the wheel, which connects to
the column. There were also $17$ notches on the other end of the
column that then connected to the car itself.

Chris had noticed that moving the wheel 1 notch changed its position by 
\[
\frac{365}{21} \approx 17 \text{ degrees,}
\]
and that adjusting the columns by 1 notch changed its position by 
\[
\frac{365}{17} \approx 21 \text{ degrees.}
\]
Hmmm so if we want to center the wheel, we want to solve the following equation:
\[
17 w + 21 c = -5
\]
where $w$ represents how many notches we turn the wheel and $c$
represents how many notches we turn the column. Ah! This sounds like
an algebra problem! There is only one issue: We have two unknowns and
a single variable.


\begin{ques}
How do we proceed from here? Can you solve the problem? Where does
modular arithmetic factor in to the solution?
\end{ques}
\QM


\subsection{Check Digits}

Our world is full of numbers. Sometimes if you are in a large
organization---say a large university---you feel a bit like a
number. How do you know if you are the right number? Allow me to
clarify. Most items you buy have some sort of \index{UPC} UPC
(Universal Product Code) on them. This allows them to be put into a
computer in an organized fashion. When you buying items in a grocery
story, you want the item you scanned to come up---and not some other
(potentially embarrassing!) item. To ensure you get what is coming to
you, we have \index{check digits}\textit{check digits}. These are
digits that ``check'' to make sure that the code has scanned
correctly. Typically, what you see are either UPC-A codes or UPC-E codes. Here is an example of a UPC-A code:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/upcaEg.pdf}
\]
The check digit is the right most digit (in this case $4$). The check
digit is not used in identifying the item, instead it is used purely
to check if the other digits are correct. Here is how you check to see
if a UPC-A code is valid:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Working modulo $10$, add the digits in the odd positions and
  multiply by $3$:
\begin{align*}
0+2+7+0+0+1 &= 10\\
10\cdot 3 &= 30 \\
30 &\equiv 0 \pmod{10}.
\end{align*}
\item Working modulo $10$, add the digits in the even positions
  (including the check digit):
\begin{align*}
4+5+2+5+0 +4 &= 20 \\
20 &\equiv 0 \pmod{10}
\end{align*}
\item Add the outcomes from the previous steps together and take the
  result modulo $10$:
\[
0 + 0  \equiv 0 \pmod{10}
\]
\end{enumerate}
If the result is congruent to $0$ modulo $10$, as it is in this case,
then you have a correct UPC-A number and you are good to go!

We should note, sometimes at stores you see UPC-E codes:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/upceEg.pdf}
\]
%\begin{center}
%\begin{pspicture}(1.5,1.2in)
%\psbarcode{0123456}{includetext}{upce}
%\end{pspicture}
%\end{center}
These are compressed UPC-A codes where $5$ zeros have been
removed. The rules for transforming UPC-A codes to UPC-E codes are a
bit tedious, so we'll skip them for now---though they are easy
to look up on the internet.


\begin{ques}
Can you find a UPC-E code and verify that it is valid?

\section{The Binomial Theorem}

\subsection{Varna-Sangita}

In ancient Indian texts we find a description of a type of music
called \textit{varna-sangita}.\index{varna-sangita} This is music made
from a variation of long and short syllables. When performing a
varna-sangita, one starts off with a given number of short syllables
and ends with the same number of long syllables. In between these
verses, every possible combination of long and short syllables is
supposed to occur. If $s$ represents a short syllable and $l$
represents a long syllable we might visualize this as:
\[
ssss  \xto{\text{every possible combination}} llll
\]

To check their work, the people of ancient India counted how many of
each combination appeared in a song. Suppose we started with $sss$ and
finished with $lll$. Our song should contain the following verses:
\[
sss,\qquad ssl,\qquad sls, \qquad lss, \qquad sll,\qquad lsl, \qquad lls,\qquad lll
\]
We can construct the following table to summarize what we have found:
\[
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
$3$ $s$'s & $2$ $s$'s and $1$ $l$ & $1$ $s$ and $2$ $l$'s & $3$ $l$'s \\ \hline
1 & 3 & 3 & 1\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\]

\begin{ques} 
What would your table look like if you started with $ss$ and finished
with $ll$? What about if you started with $ssss$ and finished with
$llll$?
\end{ques}
\QM

The vedics of the time gave a rule for making tables like the one
above. Their rule was based on the following diagram:
\[
\includegraphics[scale=1]{../graphics/pascalsTri.pdf}

Today people call this diagram \textbf{Pascal's
  triangle}.\index{Pascal's!triangle}

\subsection{Come Together}

Let's see if we can bring these ideas together. Let's denote the following symbol:
\[
\binom{n}{k} = \text{the number of ways we choose $k$ objects from $n$
  objects}.\index{nchoosek@$\binom{n}{k}$}\index{nck@$_nC_k$}
\]
it is often said ``$n$ choose $k$'' and is sometimes denoted as $_n C_k$.

\begin{ques}
What exactly does $\binom{n}{k}$ mean in terms of varna-sangitas? What
does $\binom{n}{k}$ mean in terms of expansion of binomials?
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques} How does $\binom{n}{k}$ relate to Pascal's triangle?
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques}
Pascal claims:
\[
\binom{n}{k-1} +  \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n+1}{k}
\]
Explain how this single equation basically encapsulates the key
to constructing Pascal's triangle.
\end{ques}
\QM

\begin{ques}
Suppose that an oracle tells you that
\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]
but we, being good skeptical people, are not convinced. How do we
check this?
\end{ques}
\QM

From the work above, we obtain a fabulous theorem:


\begin{thm}[Binomial Theorem]\index{Binomial Theorem} 
If $n$ is a nonnegative integer, then
\[
(a+b)^n = \binom{n}{0} a^nb^0 + \binom{n}{1} a^{n-1}b^1 + \dots + \binom{n}{n-1} a^{1}b^{n-1} + \binom{n}{n} a^{0}b^n.

\section{Tonic, Dominant, Octave}

Someone once told me ``Music is how math sounds.'' I'm not totally
sure I believe them, but maybe there is some truth to what they are
saying. Sound is made by compression waves in the air. Loosely
speaking, the closer the compression waves come, the higher the pitch
the sound is that we hear. We visualize these compression waves with a
picture like this:
\[
\includegraphics[width=3in]{../graphics/basicWave.pdf}
\]
The peaks of the waves above represent high-pressure points where the
air is very compressed, and the troughs of the waves above represent
low-pressure points, where there are very few air molecules. 

Let's call a sound produced by a single compression wave a \index{tone}
\textit{tone}. When two tones are played at the same time, their waves
act together like the sum of the individual waves. Let's
see this in action. If we play the following two tones at the same
time,
\[
\includegraphics[width=3in]{../graphics/superComb.pdf}
\]
we end up with 
\[
\includegraphics[width=3in]{../graphics/superSum.pdf}
\]
which is nothing more than every point on the first graph added to
every point on the second graph. See how when the waves line up
nicely, we get a nice big wave? See how when the waves disagree, our
wave dwindles down to nothing?

Since the time when people started making sounds, we've noticed that
some tones sound better together than others. There is an easy
rule-of-thumb that will tell you when two tones will sound ``right''
together. If the graph of both waves combined has a lot of beats \index{beats}
then it will probably sound ``wrong,'' see the example below:
\[
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../graphics/minorComb.pdf}
 & \raisebox{4ex}{\huge$\Rightarrow$} &
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../graphics/minorSum.pdf}\\
& & beats
\end{tabular}
\]
If the beats are hard to see, then it will sound ``right.'' You can
see this in the following example:
\[
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../graphics/fifthComb.pdf}
 & \raisebox{4ex}{\huge$\Rightarrow$ }&
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../graphics/fifthSum.pdf} \\
& & no beats
\end{tabular}
\]
Now let's define some words:

\begin{dfn} 
The \textbf{wavelength}\index{wavelength!sinusoidal wave} of a
sinusoidal wave is length of a complete wave, the distance from peak
to peak or the distance from trough to trough.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn} 
The \textbf{frequency}\index{frequency!sinusoidal wave} of a sinusoidal
wave is the number of complete waves per unit time.
\end{dfn}

If we're talking about sound waves, then wavelength and frequency are related by the following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{E:sin}
w_s \cdot f = s\qquad\text{where}\qquad
\begin{tabular}{l}
$w_s$ is the wavelength of the sound wave\\
$f$ is the frequency \\
$s$ is the speed of sound 
\end{tabular}
\end{equation}



\begin{dfn} 
The tone that you start with is called the
\textbf{tonic}.\index{tonic}
\end{dfn}

So let's start with the tonic, and add a tone whose wavelength is half
that of the tonic:
\[
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../graphics/octaveComb.pdf}
 & \raisebox{4ex}{\huge$\Rightarrow$ }&
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../graphics/octaveSum.pdf}
\end{tabular}
\]
That looks like it sounds really ``right,'' as there are no beats to be seen.

\begin{dfn}
The tone whose wavelength is half that of the tonic is called the
\textbf{octave}.\index{octave}
\end{dfn}

For some reason, the human ear and brain work together to identify the
tonic and octave as \textit{the same} tone, with the octave just being
twice as high. Now let's get a little crazy, we'll start with the
tonic, and add a tone whose wavelength is $2/3$ that of the tonic:
\[
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../graphics/fifthComb.pdf}
 & \raisebox{4ex}{\huge$\Rightarrow$ }&
\includegraphics[width=2in]{../graphics/fifthSum.pdf}
\end{tabular}
\]
That looks like it sounds ``right'' too, no beats again.

\begin{dfn}
The tone whose wavelength is $2/3$ that of the tonic is called the
\textbf{dominant}.\index{dominant}
\end{dfn}

The dominant is central to all of western music. The
tonic-dominant-octave trio of tones is sometimes called a \textit{power
  chord} for its powerful sound.

\begin{ques}
Starting with just these three notions: Tonic, dominant, and octave
what tones would we want an instrument to be able to play?
\end{ques}
\QM

We seek the answer to this question.

\subsection{Instrument Building}

Close your eyes, and imagine you are on a beach in Brazil, imagine
yourself swimming in the gentle waves. While you are swimming, you
decide that when you return to your home town you are finally going to
build that stringed instrument that you've always wanted---perhaps a
lytherette. You'd have to pick some frequency for the open
string. OK---done.


\begin{ques} What do waves look like on your stringed instrument?
\end{ques}

Let me explain a somewhat sticky point. The waves made by strings on
instruments are not nice old sinusoidal waves, they are what we call
\textit{standing waves}\index{standing waves}. Standing waves look
like a vibrating string:
\[
\includegraphics[width=3in]{../graphics/stand.pdf}
\]
Notice how the string is attached at the dots on the left and right?
Points like those are called \textit{nodes}\index{nodes}. While there
are many places that nodes can be, for us nodes will always be at the
endpoints of the string.

\begin{dfn} 
The \textbf{wavelength}\index{wavelength!standing wave} of a standing
wave is twice the length from node to node.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn} 
The \textbf{frequency}\index{frequency!standing wave} of a standing
wave is the number of complete vibrations (up and down) per unit time.
\end{dfn}

If we're talking about strings on instruments, then wavelength and
frequency are related by the following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{E:standing}
w_t \cdot f = c\qquad\text{where}\qquad
\begin{tabular}{l}
$w_t$ is the wavelength of the standing wave \\
$f$ is the frequency \\
\begin{minipage}{30ex}$c$ is a constant based on the mass and tension of the string\end{minipage}
\end{tabular}
\end{equation}

\begin{ques} 
If you pluck a string, what will the wavelength of the sound wave be?
Use equations (\ref{E:sin}) and (\ref{E:standing}) to express your
answer in terms of $w_t$, $f$, $c$ and $s$.
\end{ques}
\QM


\begin{ques} 
If you shorten a string's length by one-third, what will the
wavelength of the new sound wave be?  Use equations (\ref{E:sin}) and
(\ref{E:standing}) to express your answer in terms of $w_t$, $f$, $c$
and $s$.
\end{ques}
\QM

The upshot of the two questions above is that if you want to produce a
tone whose wavelength is a fraction of another tone's wavelength, then
your merely pluck a string whose length is the same fraction of the
string that produced the original tone. Let's get back to instrument building.

\begin{ques} 
When building a musical instrument, what tones do you want to be able
to play?
\end{ques}

I'll take this one! You want to be able to play tonic (open string),
the dominant, and the octave. How do we make this happen? Let's
imagine we are building a stringed instrument. Many stringed
instruments use \textit{frets}\index{frets} (little metal things that
help make new tones) to get the desired tones. To start, we'll want to
put a fret $2/3$ along the length of the string:
\[
\includegraphics[width=3in]{../graphics/dom1.pdf}
\]
Additionally, we want to be able to play the dominant of this new tone
as well. To do this, we'll might place a new fret
\[
\frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{9}
\]
of the length of the string. 
\[
\includegraphics[width=3in]{../graphics/pdom2.pdf}
\]
Hmmmm there is a slight problem though. This new fret would create a
note \textit{higher} than the octave ($1/2$ the length of the
string). We want all of our frets to be placed between the original
tonic and octave. So let's move this fret over by lowering our new
tone by an octave. The new wavelength will be twice as long, so we'll
put a fret $8/9$ along the length of the string.
\[
\includegraphics[width=3in]{../graphics/dom2.pdf}
\]
Now repeat this process, adding a new fret for the dominant of the
previously added tone, at each step ensuring that the fret be placed
between $1/2$ and complete string length. Do this $12$ times, let's
see what happens. Fill in the fractions in the boxes below---as a
gesture of friendship, I've given you the correct decimal approximation
for each fraction:
\[
\begin{array}{|r|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
\text{fraction} &\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}            &            &            &            &            &            \\ \hline
\bigstrut[t]\text{decimal}  & 0.666\dots & 0.888\dots & 0.592\dots & 0.790\dots & 0.526\dots & 0.702\dots \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]
\[
\begin{array}{|r|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
\text{fraction}  &\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}           &            &            &            &            &            \\ \hline
\bigstrut[t]\text{decimal}   & 0.936\dots & 0.624\dots & 0.832\dots & 0.554\dots & 0.739\dots & 0.493\dots \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]
From this we find we should place a twelfth fret $0.493\dots$ along
the length of the string. To the human ear, this tone will sound quite
close to the octave of our starting tone (though slightly
lower). Hence after twelve steps we \textit{appear} to be at the
octave. If we were to put frets on our instrument at all of these
divisions, we would have something like this:
\begin{equation}\label{E:fboard}
\begin{array}{c}
\includegraphics{../graphics/fboard1.pdf}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Remember though, the twelfth fret is close to an octave, but not
perfect!  Mathematically we might say
\[
\frac{2^n}{3^m} \approx \frac{1}{2}
\]
for some integers $n$ and $m$. We note that in our case $m = 12$ and
$n$ is some other integer. Could we find integers $n$ and $m$ such that
\[
\frac{2^n}{3^m} =\frac{1}{2}?
\]
If so then we could write:
\[
2^{n+1} = 3^m \qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad 2^{(n+1)/m} = 3
\]
\begin{ques}\index{Unique Factorization Theorem} 
What does the Unique Factorization Theorem for integers say about the
above expressions? How do we proceed from here?

\section{Rational and Irrational Temperament}



In the last section, we were thinking about how to build a stringed
instrument with frets. With this in mind, we came up with the
following equation
\[
2^{\frac{n+1}{m}} = 3
\]
where $m$ is the number of divisions of the string that we would wish
to make. Armed with the Unique Factorization Theorem for
integers,\index{Unique Factorization Theorem} we could (and you will!)
explain that there is no rational solution of
\[
2^x = 3,
\]
meaning that  finding appropriate values of $n$ and $m$ is
actually impossible! It's a good thing that we are not the type of
people to be deterred by the impossible. In light of our discussion
above, we want to find a fraction:
\[
\frac{n+1}{m} \approx \log_2(3) = 1.58496250072115618145373894394\dots
\]

\begin{ques} 
How do we find good fractional approximations of irrational numbers?
\end{ques}

In two words: Continued fractions.\index{continued fraction} Set:
\[
x_1 = 1.58496250072115618145373894394\dots
\]
Write $x$ in terms of its whole-number part and its fractional part:
\[
x_1 = \mathbf{1} + (x_1-1)
\]
Now look at the reciprocal of $(x_1-1)$:
\begin{align*}
x_2 &=\frac{1}{x_1-1} = 1.70951129135145477697619026217\dots\\
x_2 &= \mathbf{1} + (x_2-1)
\end{align*}
Continue on:
\begin{align*}
x_3 &=\frac{1}{x_2-1} = 1.40942083965320900458240433081\dots\\
x_3 &= \mathbf{1} + (x_3-1)
\end{align*}
Again, again!
\begin{align*}
x_4 &=\frac{1}{x_3-1} = 2.44247459618085927548717403238\dots\\
x_4 &= \mathbf{2} + (x_4-2)
\end{align*}
One last time:
\begin{align*}
x_5 &=\frac{1}{x_4-2} = 2.26001675267082453593127612260\dots\\
x_5 &= \mathbf{2} + (x_5-2)
\end{align*}
Whew, now I'm tired, we could continue on but I think it is time to
stop. Let's see what our continued fraction looks like:
\[
\log_2(3) \approx 1 + \dfrac{1}{1+\dfrac{1}{1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}}
\]
If we simplify this continued fraction into a regular old fraction we find:
\[
\log_2(3) \approx \frac{19}{12} = 1.58333333333\dots
\]
Check this out:
\[
2^{19/12} = 2.9966141537\dots
\]
This is really close to $3$, thus $2^{19/12}$ is a good approximation
of $\log_2(3)$. Write
\begin{align*}
3&\approx 2^{19/12} \\
\frac{2}{3} &\approx \frac{2}{2^{19/12}} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{2^{7/12}}
\end{align*}




With this in mind, we will adopt the convention that
the $n$th tone above the tonic will have a wavelength of exactly
$1/2^{n/12}$ of the tonic:
\[
\includegraphics[width=3in]{../graphics/firstFret.pdf}
\]
In particular, since 
\[
\frac{1}{2^{1/12}} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{1/12}} = \frac{1}{2^{2/12}}
\]
if we work with wavelengths of $1/2^{n/12}$ of the tonic, we will
obtain a nice approximation of every tone we produced before. After
$7$ steps,
\[
\frac{1}{2^{7/12}} = 0.66741992\dots \approx \frac{2}{3}
\]
and additionally, 
\[
\frac{1}{2^{12/12}} = \frac{1}{2},
\]
so after twelve steps we are exactly at the octave! If we put a frets
at the points $\frac{1}{2^{n/12}}$ letting $n$ run from $0$ to $12$, we'll obtain a picture like:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/eqFret.pdf}
\]
Let's compare this to our fret positions in diagram~(\ref{E:fboard}):
\[

\subsection{Equal Temperament}

Spacing the division of the tones by making use of wavelengths that
are $\frac{1}{2^{1/12}}$ of the tonic is called \textbf{equal
  temperament}\index{equal temperament}. This is how modern guitars
and pianos are tuned. People have also identified other ratios of the
wavelength of the tonic that they thought sounded ``right.''
Essentially, they have taken the idea that we should have as few
``beats'' as possible to the extreme. When they do this, and attempt
to have $12$ tones, they arrive at what is called \textbf{just
  intonation}\index{just intonation}. When \textit{a
  cappella}\index{\textit{a cappella}@acappella} groups sing and form
chords, they usually sing using just intonation---the human brain
seems to be somehow drawn to these sounds. Here are the ratios of the
wavelength of the tonic used in just intonation:
\begin{align*}
&1/2,\quad 8/15,\quad 5/9,\quad 3/5,\quad 5/8,\quad 2/3,\\
&32/45,\quad 3/4,\quad 4/5,\quad 5/6,\quad 8/9,\quad 24/25
\end{align*}
Let's compare these to the ratios used in equal temperament:
\[
\begin{tabular}{rr@{\,}c@{\,}lr@{\,}c@{\,}l}
Tone & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Equal Temperament}   & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Just Intonation}   \\ \hline

$3$  & $1/2^{3/12}$  & $=$ & $0.840\dots$  & $5/6$   & $=$& $0.833\dots$ \\
$2$  & $1/2^{2/12}$  & $=$ & $0.890\dots$  & $8/9$   & $=$& $0.888\dots$ \\
$1$  & $1/2^{1/12}$  & $=$ & $0.943\dots$  & $24/25$ & $=$& $0.96\dots$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

The real issue with just intonation comes with we try to raise every
note up by a given number of steps. Suppose a singer has trouble
singing in the range of some song, yet has no problems if we raise
every note of the song up by $1$ half step. If our instrument is in
equal temperament, then this shift of tones will have no adverse
effects. However, if our instrument is in just intonation, then check
out what happens:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $24/25$ of a wavelength be the new tonic---this is 1 half
  step.
\item Now $7$ steps up will be $5/8$ of a wavelength.
\end{itemize}
Checking out the new ratio we find:
\[
\frac{5/8}{24/25} = 0.651042 
\]  
This is over a $2 \%$ difference from $2/3$ of the tonic. Believe it
or not, this will be noticeably ``wrong'' to the human ear. With
equal temperament, the tone will still be spot-on.

These issues with musical instruments arise due to intrinsic
differences between rational and irrational numbers. The tones that
sound best to our ears are all defined by ratios of the wavelength of
the tonic. However, moving up by these ratios is done via
multiplication, and hence logarithms enter the scene. The Unique
Factorization Theorem for integers\index{Unique Factorization Theorem}
tells us that the ratios that we are most interested in cannot be
obtained simply from the other ratios we are interested in. From all
this arises a fascinating problem that everyone experiences without
even realizing it!
