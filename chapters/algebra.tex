\section{Home Base}
Imagine 600 generations past---that's on the order of 10000 years, the
dawn of what we would call civilization. This is a long time ago, well
before the \textit{Epic of Gilgamesh}. Even then people already knew
the need to keep track of numbers. However, they didn't use the
numbers we know and love (that's right, \textit{love}!), they used
tally-marks.\index{tally-marks} Now what if ``a friend'' of yours had
a time machine? What if they traveled through time and space and they
decided to take you back 500 generations? Perhaps you would meet a
nice man named Lothar\footnote{\textit{Lothar of the Hill People} is
  his full name}\index{Lothar of the Hill People} who is trying to
keep track of his goats. He has the following written on a clay
tablet:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/lothar.pdf}
\]
From this picture you discern that Lothar has $69$ goats. Lothar is
studying the tablet intently when his wife, Gertrude, comes in. She
tries in vain to get Lothar to keep track of his goats using another
set of symbols:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/numbers.pdf}
\]
A heated debate between Lothar and Gertrude ensues, the exact details
of which are still a mystery. We do glean the following facts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Under Gertrude's scheme, five goats are denoted by:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/gfive.pdf}
\]
\item The total number of Lothar's goats is denoted by: 
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/ggoats.pdf}
\]
\end{enumerate}
\begin{question} Can you explain Gertrude's counting scheme?
\end{question}
\QM 

Did I mention that ``your friend's'' time machine is also a spaceship?
Oh\dots Well it is. Now you both travel to the planet Omicron Persei
8.\index{Omicron Persei 8} There are two things you should know about
the inhabitants of Omicron Persei 8:
\begin{enumerate}
\item They only have 3 fingers on each hand.
\item They can eat a human in one bite.
\end{enumerate}
As you can see, there are serious issues that any human visitor to
Omicron Persei 8 must deal with. For one thing, since the Omicronians
only have 3 fingers on each hand, they've only written down the
following symbols for counting:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/op8numbers.pdf}
\]
Emperor Lrrr of the Omicronians is tallying how many humans he ate
last week
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/leathuman.pdf}
\]
when his wife, Ndnd, comes in and reminds him that he can write this
number using their fancy symbols as:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/op8numbershe.pdf}
\]
After reading some restaurant menus, you find out that twelve
tally-marks are denoted by the symbols:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/op8number12.pdf}
\]
\begin{question} Can you explain the Omicronians' counting scheme?
\end{question}
\QM

At this point you hop back into ``your friend's'' space-time
ship. ``Your friend'' kicks off their shoes. You notice that ``your
friend'' has 6 toes on each foot. You strike up a conversation about
the plethora of toes. Apparently this anomaly has enabled ``your
friend'' to create their own counting scheme, which they say is based
on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Toes
\item Feets
\item Feets of Feets
\item and so on\dots
\end{itemize}
``Your friend'' informs you that they would write the number you know
as ``twenty-six'' as $22$ or ``two feets and two toes.'' What?! Though
you find the conversation to be dull and stinky, you also find out
that ``your friend'' uses two more symbols when they count. ``Your
friend'' uses the letter $A$ to mean what you call ``ten,'' and the
letter $B$ to mean what you call ``eleven!''

  are $10$ types of people in the world. Those who understand base two
  and those who don't.}
\item You meet some Tripod aliens, they tally by threes. Thankfully
  for everyone involved, they use the symbols $0$, $1$, and $2$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can you explain how a Tripod would count from $11$ to $201$? Be

\begin{enumerate}
\item What do the individual symbols $O$, $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, and
  $F$ mean?

  Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}
\item Now, suppose that you meet a hermit who tallies by
  thirteens. Explain how he might count. Give some relevant and
  revealing examples.
% The following problem used to begin $1/6$ of $30$ is $4$, but that allowed  
% proportional reasoning to give the correct answer.  The numbers have been changed.  
\item While visiting Mos Eisley spaceport, you stop by Chalmun's
  Cantina. After you sit down, you notice that one of the other aliens
  is holding a discussion on fractions. Much to your surprise, they
  explain that $1/6$ of $36$ is $7$. You are unhappy with this,
  knowing that $1/6$ of $36$ is in fact $6$, yet their audience seems
  to agree with it, not you. Next the alien challenges its audience by
  asking, ``What is $1/4$ of $10$?'' What is the correct answer to
  this question, and how many fingers do the aliens have? Explain your
  reasoning.
\item When the first Venusian to visit Earth attended a sixth grade
  class, it watched the teacher show that
\[

``How strange,'' thought the Martian. ``On Mars, $x = 5$ is a solution
of this equation, but there also is another solution.'' If Martians
have more fingers than humans, how many fingers do Martians have on both hands?

\section{Arithmetic}\label{S:aritmetic}

Consider this question:
\begin{activitynote}
Activity \ref{A:HAr} complements this section well.  % Hieroglyphical Arithmetic
\end{activitynote}
\begin{question}
Can you \textit{think} about something if you lack the
\textit{vocabulary} required to discuss it?
\end{question}
\QM

\subsection{Nomenclature}
The numbers and operations we work with have properties whose
importance are so fundamental that we have given them names. Each of
these properties is surely well known to you; however, the importance
of the name is that it gives a keen observer the ability to see and
articulate fundamental structures in arithmetic and algebra.

\paragraph{The Associative Property}\index{associativity} 
An operation \ding{72} is called \textbf{associative} if for all
numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$:
\[
a \,\text{\ding{72}}\, (b \,\text{\ding{72}}\, c) = (a \,\text{\ding{72}}\, b) \,\text{\ding{72}}\, c
\]


\paragraph{The Commutative Property}\index{commutativity}
An operation $\,\text{\ding{72}}\,$ is called \textbf{commutative} if for all
numbers $a$ and $b$:
\[
a \,\text{\ding{72}}\, b = b \,\text{\ding{72}}\, a
\]

\paragraph{The Distributive Property}\index{distributivity}
An operation $\,\text{\ding{72}}\,$ is said to be \textbf{distributive} over another
operation \ding{66} if for all numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$:
\[
a \,\text{\ding{72}}\,(b \,\text{\ding{66}}\, c)  = (a \,\text{\ding{72}}\, b) \,\text{\ding{66}}\, (a\,\text{\ding{72}}\, c)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad (b \,\text{\ding{66}}\, c)\,\text{\ding{72}}\, a  = (b \,\text{\ding{72}}\, a) \,\text{\ding{66}}\, (c\,\text{\ding{72}}\, a)
\]

\paragraph{The Closure Property}\index{closure}
An operation $\,\text{\ding{72}}\,$ is called \textbf{closed} on a set of numbers if for all
numbers $a$ and $b$ in the set:
\[
a \,\text{\ding{72}}\, b \qquad \textrm{is another number in the set}.  
\]

\fixnote{Possibly add identities and inverses, which are addressed somewhat in Activity \ref{A:HAr}.)}  

You may find yourself a bit distressed over some of the notation used
above. In particular you surely notice that we were using crazy
symbols like \ding{72} and \ding{66}. We did this for a reason. The
properties above may hold for more than one operation. Let's explore
this:

\begin{question}
Can you give examples of operations that are associative? Can you give
examples of operations that are not associative?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Can you give examples of operations that are commutative? Can you give
examples of operations that are not commutative?
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{question}
Can you give examples of two operations where one distributes over the
other? Can you give examples of operations that do not distribute?
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{question}
Can you give examples of an operation and a set of numbers where 
the operation is closed on the set of numbers?  Can you give examples 
of an operation and a set of numbers where 
the operation is not closed on the set of numbers? 
\end{question}
\QM


\subsection{Algorithms}
In elementary school you learned many strategies for addition and subtraction.\standard{2.NBT.9}  
Some of these strategies can be developed into \emph{algorithms}, which are general step-by-step procedures 
for computation.  In this section, we aim to explain various strategies and algorithms for addition and subtraction, and our tools are place value and the properties of operations.\standard{3.NBT.2}
\begin{teachingnote}
Here we seek to have the students acknowledge the algebra behind many
algorithms. We have given a number of examples illustrating the sort
of work we wish to see.
\end{teachingnote}

\paragraph{Standard Addition Algorithm}\index{addition algorithm!standard}
Here is an example of a standard addition algorithm:
\[
\begin{tabular}{@{}r@{}}
11~~\\
892\\
+398\\ \hline
1290
\end{tabular}
\]

\begin{question}
Can you describe how to perform this algorithm?
\end{question}

As a gesture of friendship, I'll take this one. All we are doing here
is adding each column of digits at a time, starting with the right-most
digit
\[
\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}}
89\textbf{2}\\
+39\textbf{8}\\ \hline
~~\textbf{10}
\end{array}
\qquad
\leadsto
\qquad
\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}}
\textbf{1}~~\\
89\textbf{2}\\
+39\textbf{8}\\ \hline
~~~\textbf{0}
\end{array}
\]
If our column of digits sums to $10$ or higher, then we must ``carry''
the tens-digit of our sum to the next column. This process repeats
until we run out of digits on the left.
\[
\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}}
\textbf{1}~~\\
8\textbf{9}2\\
+3\textbf{9}8\\ \hline
~\textbf{19}0
\end{array}
\qquad
\leadsto
\qquad
\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}}
\textbf{1}1~~\\
\textbf{8}92\\
+\textbf{3}98\\ \hline
\textbf{12}90
\end{array}
\]
We're done!

\begin{question}
Can you show the ``behind-the-scenes'' algebra going on here?
\end{question}

I'll take this one too. Sure, you just write:
\begin{align*}
892 + 398 &= (8\cdot 10^2 + 9\cdot 10 + 2) + (3 \cdot 10^2 + 9\cdot 10 + 8) \\
&= 8\cdot 10^2 + 9\cdot 10 + 2 + 3 \cdot 10^2 + 9\cdot 10 + 8 \\
&= 8\cdot 10^2 + 3 \cdot 10^2 + 9\cdot 10 + 9\cdot 10 + 2 + 8 \\
&= (8 + 3)\cdot 10^2 + (9 + 9)\cdot 10 + (2 + 8) \\
&= (8 + 3)\cdot 10^2 + (9 + 9)\cdot 10 + 10 + 0\\
&= (8 + 3)\cdot 10^2 + (9 + 9+1)\cdot 10 + 0 \\
&= (8 + 3)\cdot 10^2 + (10 + 9)\cdot 10 + 0 \\
&= (8 + 3+1)\cdot 10^2 + 9\cdot 10 + 0 \\
&= 12\cdot 10^2 + 9\cdot 10 + 0 \\
&= 1290
\end{align*}
Wow! That was a lot of algebra. At each step, you should be able to
explain how to get to the next step, and state which algebraic
properties are being used.


\paragraph{Standard Multiplication Algorithm}\index{multiplication algorithm!standard}
Here is an example of a standard multiplication algorithm:

\[
\begin{array}{@{}r@{}}
23~~\\
634\\
\times~~8\\ \hline
5072
\end{array}
\]

\begin{question}
Can you describe how to perform this algorithm?
\end{question}

Me me me me! All we are doing here is multiplying each digit of the
multi-digit number by the single digit number.
\[
\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}}
63\textbf{4}\\
\times~~\textbf{8}\\ \hline
~~\textbf{32}
\end{array}
\qquad
\leadsto
\qquad
\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}}
\textbf{3}~~\\
63\textbf{4}\\
\times~~\textbf{8}\\ \hline
~~~\textbf{2}
\end{array}
\]
If our product is $10$ or higher, then we must ``carry'' the
tens-digit of our product to the next column. This ``carried'' number
is then added to our new product. This process repeats until we run
out of digits on the left.
\[
\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}}
\textbf{3}~~\\
6\textbf{3}4\\
\times~~\textbf{8}\\ \hline
~\textbf{27}2
\end{array}
\qquad

\qquad
\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}}
\textbf{2}3~~\\
\textbf{6}34\\
\times~~\textbf{8}\\ \hline
\textbf{50}72
\end{array}
\]
We're done!

\begin{question}
Can you show the ``behind-the-scenes'' algebra going on here?
\end{question}

You betcha! Just write:
\begin{align*}
634 \cdot 8 &= (6\cdot 10^2 + 3\cdot 10 + 4) \cdot 8\\
&= 6\cdot 8\cdot 10^2 + 3\cdot 8\cdot 10 + 4\cdot 8\\
&= 6\cdot 8\cdot 10^2 + 3\cdot 8\cdot 10 + 32 & &\text{(\ding{95})}\\
&= 6\cdot 8\cdot 10^2 + (3\cdot 8 + 3)\cdot 10  + 2 & &\text{(\ding{96})}\\
&= 6\cdot 8\cdot 10^2 + 270  + 2 & &\text{(\ding{100})}\\
&= (6\cdot 8+2)\cdot 10^2 + 7\cdot 10 + 2& &\text{(\ding{98})}\\
&= 50\cdot 10^2 + 7\cdot 10  + 2\\
&= 5\cdot 10^3 + 0\cdot 10^2 + 7\cdot 10  + 2\\
&= 5072
\end{align*}
Ahhhhh! Algebra works. Remember just as before, at each step you
should be able to explain how to get to the next step, and state which
algebraic properties are being used.

\begin{question} 
Can you clearly explain what happened between lines (\ding{95}) and
(\ding{96})? What about between lines (\ding{100}) and
(\ding{98})?
\end{question}
\QM

\paragraph{Long-Division Algorithm With Remainder}\index{division algorithm!long, with remainder}
\index{long division} Once more we meet with this old foe---long
division.  Here is an example:
\[
8\,\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}r} 
97 &\, \text{R}1\\ 
\cline{1-1}
\Big)\begin{array}[t]{@{}l@{}} 777\\ 
72 \\ 
\divrule{0}{2}  ~57 \\
 ~56\\
 \divrule{1}{2}
~~1
\end{array}
\end{array}
\]


\begin{question}
Can you describe how to perform this algorithm?
\end{question}

Yes! I'm all about this sort of thing. All we are doing here is single
digit division for each digit of the multi-digit dividend (the number
under the division symbol) by the single digit divisor (the left-most
number). We start by noting that $8$ won't go into $7$, and so we see
how many times $8$ goes into $77$.
\[
\textbf{8}\,\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}} 
\textbf{9}~~\\ 
\hline
\Big)\begin{array}[t]{@{}l@{}} \textbf{77}7\\ 
\textbf{72} \\ 
\divrule{0}{2}  ~\textbf{5} \\
\end{array}
\end{array}
\qquad\leftrightsquigarrow\qquad
\begin{minipage}{7ex}
\begin{align*}%\index{Division Theorem!for integers}
n &= d\cdot q + r \\
77 &= 8\cdot 9 + 5
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\]
Now we drop the other $7$ down, and see how many times $8$ goes into
$57$.
\[
\textbf{8}\,\begin{array}[b]{@{}r@{}} 
9\textbf{7}~\\ 
\hline
\Big)\begin{array}[t]{@{}l@{}} 777\\ 
72 \\ 
\divrule{0}{2}  ~\textbf{57} \\
 ~\textbf{56}\\
 \divrule{1}{2}
~~\textbf{1}\\
\end{array}
\end{array}
\qquad\leftrightsquigarrow\qquad
\begin{minipage}{7ex}
\begin{align*}
n &= d\cdot q + r \\
57 &= 8\cdot 7 + 1
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\]
This process repeats until we run out of digits in the dividend.

\begin{question}
Can you show the ``behind-the-scenes'' algebra going on here?
\end{question}

Of course---but this time things will be a bit different.
\begin{align*}
77 &= 8\cdot 9 + 5 \\
77\cdot 10 &= (8 \cdot 9  + 5 )\cdot 10 \\
77\cdot 10 &= 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10 + 5 \cdot 10 \\
77\cdot 10 + 7 &= 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10 + 5 \cdot 10 + 7 \\
777 &= 8 \cdot (9 \cdot 10) + 57 & &\text{(\ding{95})}\\
777 &= 8 \cdot (9 \cdot 10) + (8\cdot 7 + 1) & &\text{(\ding{96})}\\
777 &= 8 \cdot (9 \cdot 10) + 8\cdot 7 + 1 & &\text{(\ding{100})}\\
777 &= 8 \cdot (9 \cdot 10+7) + 1 & &\text{(\ding{98})}\\
777 &= 8 \cdot 97 + 1 
\end{align*}
Looks good to me, but remember: At each step you must be able to
explain how to get to the next step, and state which algebraic
properties are being used.


\begin{question} 
Can you clearly explain what happened between lines (\ding{95}) and
(\ding{96})? What about between lines (\ding{100}) and (\ding{98})?
\end{question}
\QM





\paragraph{Long-Division Algorithm Without Remainder}
\index{division algorithm!without remainder} 
Do you remember that the division algorithm can be done in such a way
that there is no remainder?  Here is an example of the division
algorithm without remainder:
\[
4\,\begin{array}[b]{@{}l@{}} 
~0.75\\
\hline
\Big)\begin{array}[t]{@{}l@{}}\, 3.00\\ 
\,2\;8 \\ 
\divrule{0}{3}  
~\,\;20 \\
 ~\,\;20\\
 \divrule{1}{3} \vspace{-1.4em} \\ 
 \divrule{1}{3}
\end{array}
\end{array}
\]

\begin{question}
Can you describe how to perform this algorithm?
\end{question}

I'm getting a bit tired, but I think I can do this last one. Again,
all we are doing here is single digit division for each digit of the
multi-digit dividend (the number under the division symbol) by the
single digit divisor (the left-most number) adding zeros after the
decimal point as needed. We start by noting that $4$ won't go into
$3$, and so we see how many times $4$ goes into $3.0$. Mathematically
this is the same question; however, by thinking of the $3.0$ as $30$,
we put ourselves into familiar territory. Since
\[
4 \cdot 7 = 30 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 4 \cdot 7 \cdot 10^{-1} = 30
\cdot 10^{-1} = 3
\]
this will work as long as we put our $7$ immediately to the right of
the decimal point.
\[
\textbf{4}\,\begin{array}[b]{@{}l@{}} 
~\textbf{0.7}  \\
\hline
\Big)\begin{array}[t]{@{}l@{}} \textbf{3.0}\\ 
\textbf{2\;8} \\ 
\divrule{0}{3}  
~\;\textbf{2}
\end{array}
\end{array}
\qquad\leftrightsquigarrow\qquad
\begin{minipage}{7ex}%\index{Division Theorem!for integers}
\begin{align*}
n &= d\cdot q + r \\ 30 &= 4\cdot 7 + 2
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\]
Now we are left with a remainder of $.2$. To take care of this, we
drop another $0$ down and see how many times $4$ goes into $20$. Since
\[
4 \cdot 5 = 20 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 10^{-2} = 5
\cdot 10^{-2} = 0.05
\]
this will work as long as we put our $5$ two spaces to the right of
the decimal point.

\[
\textbf{4}\,\begin{array}[b]{@{}l@{}} 
~0.7\textbf{5}\\
\hline
\Big)\begin{array}[t]{@{}l@{}} 3.0\textbf{0}\\ 
2\;8 \\ 
\divrule{0}{3}  ~\textbf{\;20} \\
 ~\;\textbf{20}\\
 \divrule{1}{3} \vspace{-1.4em} \\ 
 \divrule{1}{3}
\end{array}
\end{array}
\qquad\leftrightsquigarrow\qquad
\begin{minipage}{7ex}
\begin{align*}
n &= d\cdot q + r \\
20 &= 4\cdot 5 + 0
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\]
This process repeats until we obtain a division with no remainder, or
until we see repetition in the digits of the quotient.

\begin{question}
Can you show the ``behind-the-scenes'' algebra going on here?
\end{question}

Let's do it:
\begin{align*}
3 &= 4\cdot 0 + 3 \\
3.0 &= (4 \cdot 7  + 2 )\cdot 10^{-1} \\
3.0 &= 4 \cdot (7\cdot 10^{-1})  + 2 \cdot 10^{-1} \\
3.00 &= 4 \cdot (7\cdot 10^{-1})  + 20 \cdot 10^{-2} \\
3.00 &= 4 \cdot (7\cdot 10^{-1})  + (4\cdot 5) \cdot 10^{-2} & &\text{(\ding{100})}\\
3.00 &= 4 \cdot (7\cdot 10^{-1})  + 4\cdot (5 \cdot 10^{-2}) & &\text{(\ding{98})}\\
3.00 &= 4 \cdot (7\cdot 10^{-1}  + 5 \cdot 10^{-2}) \\
3.00 &= 4 \cdot 0.75 
\end{align*}
Looks good to me, but remember: At each step you must be able to
explain how to get to the next step, and state which algebraic
properties are being used.

\section{Algebra}



Algebra is when you replace a number with a letter, usually $x$,
right? OK---but you also do things with $x$, like make
\textit{polynomials} out of it.

\subsection{Polynomial Basics}

\begin{activitynote}
Activity \ref{A:CA} complements this section well.  % Comparative Arithmetic
\end{activitynote}



\begin{question} What's a polynomial? 
\end{question}
\QM

I'll take this one:
\begin{definition}\index{polynomial}
An $n^{th}$-degree \textbf{polynomial} in the variable $x$ is an expression of the form
\[
a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0
\]
where the $a_i$'s are all constants, $n$ is a nonnegative integer, and $a_n\neq 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{question}
Which of the following are polynomials?
\[
3x^3 - 2x + 1 \qquad \frac{1}{3x^3 - 2x + 1} \qquad 3x^{-3} - 2x^{-1} + 1 \qquad 3x^{1/3} - 2x^{1/6} + 1
\]
\end{question}
\QM


Given two polynomials
\begin{align*}
&a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0 \\
&b_mx^m + b_{m-1}x^{m-1} + \dots + b_1 x + b_0
\end{align*}
we treat these polynomials much the same way we treat numbers. Note,
an easy fact is that polynomials are equal if and only if their
coefficients are equal---this may come up again!

\begin{question} Are numbers equal if and only if their digits are equal?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
This question is foreshadowing a future discussion of real numbers. The
students will probably suggest that it is true---this is OK. We will
address this point later.
\end{teachingnote}

\begin{question} 
Can you explain how to add two polynomials? Compare and contrast this
procedure to the standard addition algorithm for counting numbers.
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question} 
Can you explain how to multiply two polynomials? Compare and contrast
this procedure to the standard multiplication algorithm for counting numbers.
\end{question}
\QM



\begin{question} 
Can you explain why someone might say that working with polynomials is
like working in ``base $x$?''
\end{question}
\QM


\subsection{Division and Polynomials}

For some reason you keep on signing up for classes with aloof old
Professor Rufus. When he was asked to teach division of polynomials
with remainders, he merely wrote
\[
d(x)\,\begin{tabular}[b]{@{}r@{} r}
$q(x)$ &\, R\,$r(x)$\\ \cline{1-1}
\Big)\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}
\bigstrut[t]$n(x)$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{tabular}
\qquad\text{where}\qquad
\begin{tabular}{l}
$d(x)$ is the divisor \\
$n(x)$ is the dividend \\
$q(x)$ is the quotient \\
$r(x)$ is the remainder
\end{tabular}
\]
and walked out of the room, again! Do you have \textit{d\'{e}j\`{a} vu}?

\begin{question} 
Can you give $3$ much needed examples of polynomial long division with
remainders?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question} 
Given polynomials $d(x)$, $n(x)$, $q(x)$, and $r(x)$ how do you know
if they leave us with a correct expression above?
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{question} 
Can you explain how to divide two polynomials? 
%Compare and contrast this procedure to the Division Theorem for
%integers.
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question} 
Can you do the polynomial long division with remainder?
\end{question}
\QM

Again, this question can be turned into a theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Division Theorem]\index{Division Theorem!for polynomials}
Given any polynomial $n(x)$ and a nonconstant polynomial $d(x)$, there exist unique
polynomials $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ such that
\vspace{1in}
\end{theorem}
\noindent The above space has intentionally been left blank for you to
fill in.
\begin{teachingnote}
Here we want the students to realize that
\[
n(x) = d(x)q(x) + r(x)\qquad\text{where } 0 \le \deg(r(x)) < \deg(d(x)) 
\]
Highlight uniqueness, using the requirement on the degree of the remainder.
\end{teachingnote}

\item Consider $x^3 + 2x + 1$. This can be thought of as a ``number'' in
  base $x$. Express this number in base $(x-1)$, that is, find $b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2,$ $b_3$ such that 
\[
b_3(x-1)^3 + b_2(x-1)^2 +b_1(x-1) + b_0 = x^3 + 2x + 1.
\]
Explain your reasoning.

\item If the polynomial
\[
p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0
\]
is thought of as a ``number'' in base $x$, describe two different ways
to find the base $(x-1)$ coefficients of $p(x)$.
