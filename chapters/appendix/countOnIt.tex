\section{You Can Count on It!}\label{A:countOnIt}
\begin{teachingnote}
 The words permutation and combination tend to promote formulaic thinking rather than careful reasoning.  And students tend to ask ``Does order matter?'' in ways that don't help them with the reasoning. 

The major purposes of this activity: (1) the multiplication principle of counting, supported by a drawn or imagined tree diagram; and (2) strong explanatory thinking around ``$n$ choose $k$,'' connecting to both traffic lights and Pascal's triangle.  

Although students will find formulas for ``$n$ choose $k$'' to be useful, we need not emphasize formulas for permutations because the multiplication principle provides it for free.   (See also the final exam review document from 2014.)
