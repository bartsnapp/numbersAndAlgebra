\section{Which Road Should We Take?}


\begin{prob} Consider a six-sided die. Without actually rolling a die, guess the number of 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, and 6's you would obtain in 50 rolls. Record your predictions in the chart below:
\[
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
\# of 1's & \# of 2's & \# of 3's & \# of 4's & \# of 5's & \# of 6's & Total \\ \hline 
\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm} \hspace{15mm} &  \hspace{15mm} & \hspace{15mm} & \hspace{15mm} & \hspace{15mm} & \hspace{15mm} & \hspace{15mm}\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\]



Now roll a die 50 times and record the number of 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, and 6's you obtain.  
\[
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
\# of 1's & \# of 2's & \# of 3's & \# of 4's & \# of 5's & \# of 6's & Total \\ \hline 
\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm} \hspace{15mm} &  \hspace{15mm} & \hspace{15mm} & \hspace{15mm} & \hspace{15mm} & \hspace{15mm} & \hspace{15mm}\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\]
How did you come up with your predictions? How do your predictions
compare with your actual results? Now make a chart to combine your
data with that of the rest of the class.

\end{prob}


\paragraph{Experiment 1}

We investigated the results of throwing one die and recording what we
saw (a $1$, a $2$, ..., or a $6$). We said that the probability of an
event (for example, getting a ``3'' in this experiment) predicts the
frequency with which we expect to see that event occur in a large
number of trials. You argued the $P(\text{seeing }3)=1/6$ (meaning we
expect to get a $3$ in about $1/6$ of our trials) because there were
six different outcomes, only one of them is a $3$, and you expected
each outcome to occur about the same number of times.

\paragraph{Experiment 2}
We are now investigating the results of throwing two dice and
recording the sum of the faces. We are trying to analyze the
probabilities associated with these sums.  Let's focus first on
$P(sum=2)=?$. We might have some different theories, such 
as the following:


\subparagraph{Theory 1} 
$P(\text{sum}=2)=1/11$. 

It was proposed that a sum of $2$ was $1$ out
of the $11$ possible sums $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12\}$.


%\subparagraph{Theory 2} $P(\text{sum}=2)=1/36$. 
%
%It was proposed that a
%sum of $2$ was $1$ of $36$ possible results, counting $1+3$ as
%different from $3+1$:
%\[
%\begin{array}{cccccc}
%1+1 & 1+2 & 1+3 & 1+4 & 1+5 & 1+6 \\
%2+1 & 2+2 & 2+3 & 2+4 & 2+5 & 2+6 \\
%3+1 & 3+2 & 3+3 & 3+4 & 3+5 & 3+6 \\
%4+1 & 4+2 & 4+3 & 4+4 & 4+5 & 4+6 \\
%5+1 & 5+2 & 5+3 & 5+4 & 5+5 & 5+6 \\
%6+1 & 6+2 & 6+3 & 6+4 & 6+5 & 6+6 
%\end{array}
%\]

\subparagraph{Theory 2} 
$P(\text{sum}=2)=1/21$. 

It was proposed that a sum of $2$ was $1$ of
$21$ possible results, counting $1+3$ as the same as $3+1$:

\[
\begin{array}{cccccc}
1+1 & - & - & - & - & - \\
2+1 & 2+2 & - & - & - & - \\
3+1 & 3+2 & 3+3 & - & - & - \\
4+1 & 4+2 & 4+3 & 4+4 & - & - \\
5+1 & 5+2 & 5+3 & 5+4 & 5+5 & - \\
6+1 & 6+2 & 6+3 & 6+4 & 6+5 & 6+6 
\end{array}
\]

\begin{prob}
Is there another theory?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Test all theories by computing the following probabilities using
  each theory:
\[
P(\text{sum}=5)=? \qquad P(\text{sum}=6)=? \qquad P(\text{sum}=7)=?
\qquad P(\text{sum}=8)=?
\]
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Which theory do you like best?  Why?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
How does your theory compare to the dice rolls we recorded in
  our class?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
 How could we test our theory further?
\end{prob}
