\section{More Playing with Blocks}\label{A:B2}\index{base-ten blocks} 
%Did you put your blocks away? Darn---there is still more to be
%done! Just so that we are all on the same page, here are the basic
%blocks:

\begin{teachingnote}
In each of the following problems, use the blocks to explain each step in the algorithm.  Then show the ``behind the scenes algebra.''


\begin{itemize}
\item Three copies of four blocks makes 12 longs.  Regroup as 1 long and 2 blocks. Write 2 below in blocks column and 1 above in longs column.
\item Three copies of three longs makes 9 longs.  Plus 1 long (from regrouping) makes 10 longs.  Regroup as 1 flat and 0 longs.  Write 0 below in the longs column and 1 above in the flats column.  
\item Three copies of 2 flats makes 6 flats.  Plus 1 flat (from regrouping) makes 7 flats.  Write 7 below in the flats column.  
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
234 \times 3 & = (2\cdot 10^2 + 3\cdot 10 + 4)\times 3 \\
&= 3\cdot 2\cdot 10^2 + 3\cdot 3\cdot 10 + 3\cdot 4 \\
&= 3\cdot 2\cdot 10^2 + 3\cdot 3\cdot 10 + 12 \\
&= 3\cdot 2\cdot 10^2 + 3\cdot 3\cdot 10 + 10 + 2\\
&= 3\cdot 2\cdot 10^2 + (3\cdot 3 + 1)\cdot 10 + 2\\
&= 3\cdot 2\cdot 10^2 + 10 \cdot 10 + 2\\
&= (3\cdot 2 + 1) \cdot 10^2 + 0 \cdot 10 + 2\\
&= 7\cdot 10^2 + 0 \cdot 10 + 2\\
&=702
\end{align*}

\begin{prob}
Now Oscar is modeling the basic multiplication algorithm:
\[
\begin{tabular}{@{}r@{}}
11~~\\
234\\
$\times$~~3\\ \hline
702
\end{tabular}
\]
\[
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{../graphics/oscarMult.pdf}
\]
Can you explain what is going on? What do you think of his model?
\end{prob}

\fixnote{Maybe fix the pictures to show missing steps.}

\begin{prob}
Here is an example of the basic division algorithm:
\[
3\,\begin{tabular}[b]{@{}r@{}r} 
67 &\, R$1$\\ 
\cline{1-1}
\Big)\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}} 202\\ 
18 \\ 
\divrule{0}{2}  ~22 \\
 ~21\\
 \divrule{1}{2}
~~1
\end{tabular}
\end{tabular}
\]
Explain how to model this algorithm with base-ten blocks, assuming that you start with 202 as two flats and two blocks and that you intend to organize them into three equal piles.  
\end{prob}

\begin{teachingnote}
\begin{itemize}
\item Encourage both 3 groups and groups of 3.  
\item For $202\div 3$, 3 doesn't go into 2 flats.  Regroup the 2 flats as 20 longs.  Then 3 groups gives 6 longs with for a total of 18 longs.  After subtraction, 2 longs are remaining. 
\item Regroup the 2 remaining longs as 20 blocks and combine with the 2 blocks to give 22 blocks.  
\item Organize the blocks into 3 groups give 7 blocks in each group for a total of 21 blocks.  After subtraction 1 block remains.  
\end{itemize}
