\section{Geometry and Multiplying Complex Numbers}\label{A:complexMultiplication}
\fixnote{Maybe simplify Louie further.  Make tables for calculation.}  

Now we'll investigate the geometry of multiplying complex
numbers. Louie Llama\index{Louie Llama} is here to help us out:
\[

\includegraphics[scale=.5]{../graphics/llama.pdf} & \qquad $\leftrightsquigarrow$\qquad& \includegraphics{../graphics/llamaPlot.pdf}\\
Louie Llama & & how we'll draw him
\end{tabular}
\]

\begin{prob} 
Here's Louie Llama hanging out near the point $0$ in the complex
plane. Multiply him by $2$. Make a table and show in the plane below what happens.

\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Now multiply him by $i$. Make a table and show in the plane below what happens.
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/complexPlane.pdf}
\]
\end{prob}

\vfill

\begin{prob} 
Now multiply Louie Llama by $1+i$. Make a table and show in the plane
below what happens.
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/complexPlane.pdf}
\]
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Now multiply Louie Llama by $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$. Make a
table and show in the plane below what happens.
\[

\begin{prob} 
Geometrically speaking, what does it mean to ``multiply'' complex
numbers?
\end{prob}




\begin{prob}
Explain what it means to ``multiply'' Louie Llama by a complex
number. Considering the different cases above, describe the
process(es) used when doing this.
