\section{Picture Models for Equivalent Fractions}


\begin{prob} 
Draw pictures to explain why:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6}
\]
Explain how your pictures show this.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob} 
Draw pictures to explain why:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{2}{4}
\]
Explain how your pictures show this.
\end{prob}



\begin{prob} 
Given equivalent fractions with $0< a\le b$ and $0 < c\le d$:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}
\]
Give a procedure for representing this equation with pictures.
\end{prob}


\begin{prob} 
Explain why if $0< a\le b$ and $0 < c\le d$:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}\qquad \text{if and only if}\qquad ad = bc
\]
Feel free to use pictures as part of your explanation.
