\section{There Are Many Factors to Consider}\label{A:CF}

\begin{prob} How many factors does the integer $60$ have?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Consider the following diagram:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/treeDia.pdf}
\]
What is going on in this diagram? What do the numbers represent? How
does it help you count the number of factors of $2^3\cdot 3^2 \cdot
5$?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Make a similar diagram for $60$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Can you devise a method for computing the number of factors that a
number has? Explain why your method works.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} How many factors does $735$ have?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
If $p$ is a prime number, how many factors does $p^n$ have?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
If $p$ and $q$ are both prime numbers, how many factors does $p^nq^m$
have?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} Which integers between $0$ and $100$ have the most factors?         
\end{prob}
