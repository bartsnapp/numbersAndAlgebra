\section{On The Road}\label{A:traffic}


\begin{prob} 
Steve likes to drive the city roads. Suppose he is driving down a road
with three traffic lights. Note, Steve is a very cautious driver and
if he sees a yellow light, he waits for it to turn red.
\begin{enumerate}
\item How many ways could he see one red light and two green lights?
\item How many ways could he see one green light and two red lights?
\item How many ways could he see all red lights?
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
Now suppose Steve is driving down a road with four traffic lights.
\begin{enumerate}
\item How many ways could he see two red light and two green lights?
\item How many ways could he see one green light and three red lights?
\item How many ways could he see all green lights?
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{prob} 
In the following chart let $n$ be the number of traffic
lights and $k$ be  the number of green lights seen. In each square, write the number of ways this number of green lights could be seen while Steve drives down the street.
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
          & k=0 & k=1 & k=2 & k=3 & k=4 & k=5 & k = 6\\
    \hline
    n=0 &\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}&       &       &       &       &   &   \\
    \hline
    n=1 &\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}  &       &       &       &       &   &   \\
    \hline
    n=2 & \rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm} &     &     &       &       &    &  \\
    \hline
    n=3 &\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}       &       &       &       &       &   &   \\
    \hline
    n=4 & \rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}      &       &       &       &       &   &   \\
    \hline
    n=5 &\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}       &       &       &       &       &   &   \\
    \hline
    n=6 &\rule[0mm]{0mm}{7mm}       &       &       &       &       &   &   \\
    \hline
\end{array}

Describe any patterns you see in your table and try to explain them in
terms of traffic lights.
