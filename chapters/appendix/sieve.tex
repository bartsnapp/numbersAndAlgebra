\section{Sieving it All Out}\label{A:Sie}

\begin{prob}
\textit{Incognito's Hall of Shoes} is a shoe store that just
  opened in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. At the moment, they have 100
  pairs of shoes in stock. At their grand opening 100 customers showed
  up. The first customer tried on every pair of shoes, the second
  customer tried on every 2nd pair, the third customer tried on every
  3rd pair, and so on until the 100th customer, who only tried on the
  last pair of shoes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which shoes were tried on by only 1 customer?
\item Which shoes were tried on by exactly 2 customers?
\item Which shoes were tried on by exactly 3 customers?
\item Which shoes were tried on by the most number of customers?
\end{enumerate}
Explain your reasoning.
\end{prob}

\fixnote{Add questions:  How many customers tried on the 45th pair?  The 81st pair?  Perhaps other questions from 1125.  After circling a new prime, which is the first one crossed out with that prime?  What was the biggest prime for which you crossed out at least one multiple?}

\fixnote{Tie or untie shoes?}

\begin{prob} 
Can you use the techniques from the problem above to find a way to
systematically find all the primes from $1$ to $120$ \textit{without}
doing any division? As a jesture of friendship, we've listed out the
numbers from $1$ to $120$.
