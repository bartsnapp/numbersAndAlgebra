\section{The Integers}
An important theme in this course is distinguishing among the various number systems of school mathematics.  A \emph{number system} is a set of numbers together with arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, on those numbers.  We have already been using \textit{counting numbers}.  Now we need to be more precise.  

\begin{teachingnote}
A theme in this chapter and throughout the course is ``general reasoning with specific numbers.''
\end{teachingnote}

\begin{definition}\index{integers}\index{Z@$\Z$}
The \textbf{counting numbers}, often called the \textbf{natural numbers}, are (naturally) those use for counting.  We use the symbol $\N$ to denote the counting numbers:  
\[
\N = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots\}
\]

When $0$ is included with the counting numbers, we have the set of \textbf{whole numbers}, denoted $\W$:  
\[
\W = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots\}
\]

The set of counting numbers, zero, and negative counting numbers is called
the set of \textbf{integers}, denoted $\Z$:
\[
\Z = \{\dots, -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots \}
\]
\end{definition}

In case you're wondering, the symbol $\Z$ is used because
\textit{Zahlen} is the German word for ``numbers.'' 

\subsection{Addition}
\begin{teachingnote}
Key meanings of addition are ``adding to'' and ``putting together.''
\end{teachingnote}

Addition is probably the first operation we learn.    

\begin{question}
Write a story problem whose solution is given by the expression
$19+17$. Let this context be a ``working model'' for addition.
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Does your model show associativity of addition? If so, explain how. If
not, can you come up with a new model (story problem) that does?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Does your model show commutativity of addition? If so, explain how. If
not, can you come up with a new model that does?
\end{question}
\QM

An observant reader might notice that we have thus far given no reason to have 
negative integers.  

\begin{question}
Describe some contexts (story problems) in which negative numbers are useful.  
It will help to think of contexts in which there are ``opposite'' numbers in some sense.  
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Does your addition model work with negative integers?  In other words, does it model 
$19+ (-17)$ and $8 + (-13)$?  If so, explain how. If not, can you modify your model or 
come up with a new model that does work?
\end{question}
\QM

\subsection{Subtraction}
\begin{question}
Write a story problem whose solution is given by the expression
$19-17$. Let this context be a ``working'' model for subtraction.  
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
We know that 
\[
a - b  = a + (-b),
\]
but the left-hand side of the equation is conceptually
different from the right-hand side of the equation. Write two story
problems, one solved by $19-17$ and the other solved by
$19+(-17)$. What's the difference? (Pun intended!)
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
Here we are trying to have the students develop the ``take-away,''
along with the ``missing addend,'' and a ``comparison'' model for
subtraction.
\end{teachingnote}


\begin{question}
Can you use the two story problems above to model
\[
(-19)-17, \qquad  19 - (-17), \qquad (-19) - (-17)?
\]
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
How is \emph{subtraction} different from \emph{negation}?  
\end{question}
\QM

\subsection{Multiplication}
Multiplication is more multifaceted than addition. 

\begin{question}
Write a story problem whose solution is given by the expression
$19\cdot 17$. Let this context be a ``working'' model for multiplication. 
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
We would like to point out that the units used in addition are generally
the same for the different summands. However, with multiplication, the
different factors often have different units.
\end{teachingnote}

\begin{question}
Does your model show commutativity of multiplication? If so, explain
how. If not, can you come up with a new model that does?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Does your model show associativity of multiplication? If so, explain
how. If not, can you come up with a new model that does?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
This question is with Problem~\ref{P:MA} of
Section~\ref{S:aritmetic} in mind. In particular to show
associativity, we suggest appealing to the notion of volume.
\end{teachingnote}


\begin{question}
Does your model work with negative integers? In particular does your
model show that
\[
\text{positive}\cdot \text{negative} = \text{negative},
\]
\[
\text{negative}\cdot \text{positive} = \text{negative},
\]
and 
\[
\text{negative}\cdot \text{negative} = \text{positive}?
\]
If so, explain how. If not, can you come up with a new model that
does?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
This is difficult. The students may not be able to come up with a
model that works. This is OK---as this issue is addressed in
Problem~\ref{P:NNP}.
\end{teachingnote}


\subsection{Division} 

While addition and multiplication are good operations, the real
``meat'' of the situation comes with division.

\begin{definition}\index{divides}    %\index{dn@$d "| n$} %% the pipe breaks stuff
We say that a non-zero integer $d$ \textbf{divides} an integer $n$ if there is
an integer $q$ such that 
\[
n = dq.
\]
In this case we write $d \mid n$, which is said: ``$d$ divides $n$.''  If $d$ does not divide $n$, 
we sometimes write $d \nmid n$.  
\end{definition}

While this may seem easy, it is actually quite tricky. You must always
remember the following synonyms for \textit{divides}:
\[\index{multiple}\index{factor}
\text{``$d$ \textbf{divides} $n$''}\leftrightsquigarrow 
\text{``$d$ is a \textbf{divisor} of $n$''}\leftrightsquigarrow
\text{``$d$ is  a \textbf{factor} of $n$''}\leftrightsquigarrow 
\text{``$n$ is a  \textbf{multiple} of $d$''}
\]

\begin{activitynote}
Activity \ref{A:dm} complements this section well.  % What Can Division Mean
\end{activitynote}

\begin{definition}\index{prime number} 
A \textbf{prime} number is a positive integer with exactly two
positive divisors, namely $1$ and itself.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\index{composite number} 
A \textbf{composite} number is a positive integer with more than two
positive divisors.
\end{definition}

I claim that every composite number is divisible by a prime number. Do
you believe me? If not, consider this:
\begin{quote}
Suppose there was a composite number that was \textit{not} divisible
by a prime. Then there would necessarily be a \textit{smallest}
composite number that is not divisible by a prime. Since this number
is composite, this number is the product of two even smaller numbers,
both of which have prime divisors. Hence our original number must have
prime divisors.
\end{quote}
\begin{question} 
What the heck just happened?! Can you rewrite the above paragraph,
drawing pictures and/or using symbols as necessary, making it more
clear?
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{activitynote}
Activity \ref{A:Pr} complements this section well.  %  There's Always Another Prime
\end{activitynote}


\subsection{Factoring}

At this point we can factor any composite completely into primes. To
do this, it is often convenient to make a \textit{factor
  tree}:\index{factor tree}

\[
\xymatrix@R=0pt@C=10pt{
  & 360 \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] & & & & &\\
2 &     & 180 \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] & & & & \\ 
  &  2   &     & 90 \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] & & & \\
  &      &  2  &    & 45  \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] & & \\ 
  &      &     & 5  &    & 9 \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] &\\ 
  &      &     &    &  3  &  & 3
}
\]

From this tree\footnote{Why is this a tree? It looks more like roots to me!} we see that
\[
360 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5.
\]

At each step we simply divided by whichever prime number seemed most
obvious, branched off the tree and kept on going. From our factor
tree, we can see some of the divisors of the integer in
question. However, there are many composite factors that can be built
up from the prime divisors. One of the most important is the
\textit{greatest common divisor}.

\begin{definition}\index{GCD}\index{greatest common divisor} 
The \textbf{greatest common divisor} (GCD) of two integers $a$ and $b$ (not both 0)
is a positive integer $g = \gcd(a,b)$ where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g|a$ and $g|b$.
\item If $d|a$ and $d|b$, then $0 < d \le g$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{question}
Describe informally what the greatest common divisor of two numbers means.  
Explain how the two conditions in the formal definition appear in your informal description. 
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
What can you conclude when $\gcd(a,b)=1$?  Explain. 
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
How can you use a factor tree to compute the GCD of two integers?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Describe informally what the least common multiple (LCM)\index{LCM}\index{least common multiple} 
of two numbers means.  Write a formal definition of LCM.  Explain how the two conditions in the formal 
definition appear in your informal description. 
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
How can you use a factor tree to compute the LCM of two integers?
\end{question}
\QM


So, to factor an integer or find the GCD, one could use a factor
tree. However, when building the factor tree, we had to know what
primes to divide by. What if no prime comes to mind? What if you want
to factor the integer $391$ or $397$? This raises a new question:

\begin{question} 
How do you check to see if a given integer is prime? What possible
divisors must you check? When can you stop checking?
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{activitynote}

\end{activitynote}


%\begin{question}
%How should you identify all the primes between $1$ and $100$? Big
%hint: Maybe you should either go to the shoe store, or read up on
%Eratosthenes.\index{Eratosthenes}
%\end{question}
%\QM







\subsection{Division with Remainder}


We all remember long division\index{long division}, or at least we
remember \textit{doing} long division. Sometimes, we need to be
reminded of our \textit{forgotten foes}\index{forgotten foes}. When
aloof old Professor Rufus was trying to explain division to his class,
he merely wrote
\[
d\,\begin{tabular}[b]{@{}r@{} r}
$q$ &\, R\,$r$\\ \cline{1-1}
\big)\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}
$n$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{tabular}
\qquad\text{where}\qquad
\begin{tabular}{l}
$d$ is the divisor \\ \index{divisor}
$n$ is the dividend \\ \index{dividend}
$q$ is the quotient \\ \index{quotient}
$r$ is the remainder \index{remainder}
\end{tabular}
\]
and walked out of the room.

\begin{question} 
Can you give $3$ much needed examples of long division with
remainders?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question} 
Given positive integers $d$, $n$, $q$, and $r$ how do you know if they
leave us with a correct expression above?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question} 
Given positive integers $d$ and $n$, how many different sets of $q$
and $r$ can you find that will leave us with a correct expression
above?
\end{question}
\QM


The innocuous questions above can be turned into a theorem. We'll start
it for you, but you must finish it off yourself:

\begin{theorem}[Division Theorem]\index{Division Theorem!for integers}
Given any integer $n$ and a nonzero integer $d$, there exist unique
integers $q$ and $r$ such that
\vspace{1in}
\end{theorem}
\noindent The above space has intentionally been left blank for you to
fill in.


\begin{teachingnote}
Here we want the students to realize that
\[
n = dq + r\qquad\text{where } 0 \le r < d 
\]
\end{teachingnote}


Now consider the following picture:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/divisionThmProof.pdf}
\]
\begin{question} 
How does the picture above ``prove'' the Division Theorem for positive
integers? How must we change the picture if we allow negative values
for $n$ and $d$?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
Highlight uniqueness:  The requirement that  $0 \le r < d$ makes both $d$ and $r$ unique.  Without that requirement, 
many $d$ and $r$ pairs will work.  

The second part of this question is quite challenging.  Some specific examples can help.

\section{The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic}\index{Fundamental Theorem!of arithmetic}\label{S:FT}
In the previous section, we found divisors, greatest common divisors, and prime factors of positive integers.  And when we
 found prime factorizations of integers, we used factor trees to organize our work.  

\begin{question}
Jake and Jenna use factor trees to find prime factorizations of the same large number.  Assuming that they don't make any mistakes will their prime factorizations be the same or could they be different?  Explain.  
\end{question}
\QM

Let's try a simpler question. 

\begin{question} If $11 | 50a$, is it true that $11|a$?  Explain and generalize.  
\end{question}
\QM


The following \textit{lemma}\index{lemma} will help us tie these 
ideas together.  What is a lemma, you
ask? A lemma is nothing but a little theorem that helps us solve
another problem.

%Note that a lemma should not be confused with the
%more sour \index{lemon|see{lemma}}\textit{lemon}, as that is something
%different and unrelated to what we are discussing.

\begin{lemma}[Euclid's Lemma]\index{Euclid's Lemma} 
If $p$ is a prime number and $a$ and $b$ are integers
\[
p|ab \qquad\text{implies that} \qquad p | a\text{ or } p|b.
\]
\end{lemma}

We are going to assume Euclid's Lemma without proof (at least for now) because we want to use 
it to prove our fundamental theorem---sometimes called the \textit{Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic}:

\begin{activitynote}
Activity \ref{A:Prome} complements this section well.  % Prome Factorization
\end{activitynote}

\begin{theorem}[Unique Factorization]\index{Unique Factorization Theorem}\index{Fundamental Theorem!of Arithmetic}
Every integer greater than 1 can be factored uniquely (up to ordering)
into primes.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Well, if an integer is prime, we are done. If an integer is composite,
then it is divisible by a prime number. Divide and repeat with the
quotient. If our original integer was $n$, we'll eventually get:
\[
n = p_1p_2 \cdots p_m
\]
where some of the $p_i$'s may be duplicates. 

How do we know this factorization is unique? Well, suppose that
\[
n = p_1p_2 \cdots p_m = q_1q_2\cdots q_l
\]
where the $p_i$'s and the $q_j$'s are all prime. By the
definition of ``divides''
\[
p_1 |q_1(q_2\cdots q_l).
\]
So by Euclid's Lemma, $p_1$ must divide either $q_1$ or $(q_2\cdots q_l)$. 
If $p_1 \nmid q_1$, then 
\[
p_1 |q_2(q_3\cdots q_l).
\]
Repeat this
enough times and you will find that $p_1 | q_j$ for one of the $q_j$'s
above, which implies that $p_1 = q_j$. Repeat this process for all 
the $p_i$'s and you see that the factorization is unique.

Huh?! Can you explain what just happened drawing pictures and/or using
symbols as necessary? How do we know the process will terminate?

From high school algebra, you have lots of tools for solving equations.  
But in some situations, we are interested only in whole number or integer solutions 
to these equations.  These kinds of equations have a special name:  

\begin{definition}\index{Diophantine equation}
A \textbf{Diophantine equation} is an equation where only integer
solutions are deemed acceptable.
\end{definition}

In this section, we are particularly interested solve \textit{linear Diophantine equations}, that is, equations of the form:
\[
ax + by = c
\]
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers and the only solutions we will
accept are pairs of integers $x$ and $y$.

\section{The Euclidean Algorithm}\index{Euclidean algorithm}\label{S:EA}
In section~\ref{S:FT}, we assumed Euclid's Lemma and used it to prove the Fundamental 
Theorem of Arithmetic (aka Unique Factorization).  In this section, we backtrack 
to prove Euclid's Lemma.  

\begin{question}
What was Euclid's Lemma?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
An important point of this section is to make the student think about
the distributive property. One should try to point out each time
\[
a(x+y) = ax + ay
\]
occurs.
\end{teachingnote}

Up to this point, computing the GCD of two integers required you to
factor both numbers.  This can be difficult to do. The following
algorithm, called the \textit{Euclidean algorithm}, makes finding
GCD's quite easy. With that said, algorithms can be tricky to
explain. Let's try this---study the following calculations, they are
examples of the Euclidean algorithm in action:
\begin{align*}
22 &= 6\cdot 3 + 4\\ 
6 &= 4\cdot 1 + \fbox{$2$}\\ 4 &= 2 \cdot 2 + 0 \qquad 
\fbox{$\therefore \gcd(22,6) = 2$}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
33 &= 24\cdot 1 + 9\\
24 &= 9 \cdot 2 + 6\\
9 &= 6 \cdot 1 + \fbox{$3$}\\
6 &= 3 \cdot 2 + 0 \qquad \fbox{$\therefore \gcd(33,24) = 3$} 
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
42 &= 16\cdot 2 + 10\\
16 &= 10 \cdot 1 + 6\\
10 &= 6 \cdot 1 + 4\\
6 &= 4 \cdot 1 + \fbox{$2$}\\
4 &= 2 \cdot 2 + 0 \qquad \fbox{$\therefore \gcd(42,16) = 2$} 
\end{align*}

\begin{question}
Can you describe how to do the Euclidean algorithm?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Can you explain why the Euclidean algorithm will always stop? Hint:
Division Theorem.
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{activitynote}
Activity \ref{A:GCDwork} complements this section well.  % Why Does It Work? 
\end{activitynote}


The algorithm demonstrated above is called the \textit{Euclidean
  algorithm} or \textit{Euclid's algorithm} because
Euclid\index{Euclid} uses it several times in Books VII and X of his
book \textit{The Elements}. Donald Knuth\index{Knuth} gives a
description of the Euclidean algorithm in the first volume of his
series of books \textit{The Art of Computer Programming}. Given
integers $m$ and $n$, he describes it as follows:
\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item\label{A:E1} [Find remainder.] Divide $m$ by $n$ and let $r$ be the remainder. (We will have $0\le r< n$.)
\item{[Is it zero?]} If $r=0$, the algorithm terminates; $n$ is the answer.
\item{[Interchange.]} Set $m \leftarrow n$, $n \leftarrow r$, and go
  back to step \ref{A:E1}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{question}
What do you think of this description? How does it compare to your
description of the Euclidean algorithm?
\end{question}
\QM

While the Euclidean algorithm is handy and fun, its real power is that
it helps us solve equations. Specifically it helps us solve 
linear Diophantine equations.

Let's study the following calculations:

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\begin{minipage}{15em}
{\begin{align*}
22 &= 6\cdot 3 + 4 &\Leftrightarrow & &  22-6\cdot 3 &= 4\\ 
6 &= 4\cdot 1 + 2 &\Leftrightarrow  & &  6 - 4\cdot 1 &= 2\\ 
4 &= 2 \cdot 2 + 0 
\end{align*}}
\end{minipage}
&
\begin{minipage}{15em}
{\begin{align*}
6 - 4\cdot 1 &= 2 \\
6 - (22-6\cdot 3)\cdot 1 &= 2 \\
6\cdot 4 + 22(-1) &= 2 
\end{align*}}
\end{minipage} \\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\fbox{$\therefore 22x + 6y =2$ where $x = -1$ and $y = 4$}}
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{lr}

{\begin{align*}
33 &= 24\cdot 1 + 9 & \Leftrightarrow & & 33 - 24\cdot 1 &= 9\\
24 &= 9 \cdot 2 + 6 & \Leftrightarrow & & 24 - 9\cdot 2 &= 6\\
9 &= 6 \cdot 1 + 3 & \Leftrightarrow & & 9 - 6 \cdot 1  &= 3\\
6 &= 3 \cdot 2 + 0  
\end{align*}}
\end{minipage}
&
\begin{minipage}{15em}
{\begin{align*}
9 - 6 \cdot 1  &= 3 \\
9 - (24 - 9\cdot 2) \cdot 1  &= 3 \\
9\cdot 3 +  24\cdot(-1)  &= 3 \\
(33 - 24\cdot 1)\cdot 3 +  24\cdot(-1)  &= 3 \\
33\cdot 3 + 24\cdot (-4) &=3
\end{align*}}
\end{minipage} \\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\fbox{$\therefore 33x + 24y =3$ where $x = 3$ and $y = -4$}}
\end{tabular}


\begin{question} 
Can you explain how to solve Diophantine equations of the form
\[
ax + by = g
\]
where $g = \gcd(a,b)$?
\end{question}
\QM



The Euclidean algorithm is also useful for theoretical
questions.

\begin{question} 
Given integers $a$ and $b$, what is the smallest positive integer that
can be expressed as
\[
ax + by
\]
where $x$ and $y$ are also integers?
\end{question}

\fixnote{This argument could be improved, as could the corresponding activity, \ref{A:GCDwork}.}

I'm feeling chatty, so I'll take this one. I claim that $g =
\gcd(a,b)$ is the smallest positive integer that can be
expressed as
\[
ax + by
\]
where $x$ and $y$ are integers. How do I know? Well first, the Euclidean algorithm shows that $g$ can be 
expressed as a sum $ax + by$.  (Why?)  

Second, suppose there was
a smaller positive integer, say $s$ where:
\[
ax + by = s
\]
Hmmm\dots but we know that $g|a$ and $g|b$. This means that $g$
divides the left-hand-side of the equation. This means that $g$
divides the right-hand-side of the equation. So $g|s$---but this is
impossible, as $s< g$. Thus $g$ is the smallest integer that can be
expressed as $ax +by$.


\begin{question} Can you now use the Euclidean Algorithm to prove Euclid's Lemma?
\end{question}

\section{Rational Numbers}

Once you are familiar with integers, you start to notice something:
Given an integer, it may or may not divide into another integer
evenly. This property is at the heart of our notions of factoring and
primality. Life would be very different if all nonzero integers
divided evenly into one another. With this in mind, we introduce
\textit{rational numbers}.  
\begin{activitynote}
Activities \ref{A:EF} and \ref{A:FO} complement this section well.  
% Picture Models for Equivalent Fractions & Picture Models for Fraction Operations
\end{activitynote}



\begin{definition} 
A \textbf{rational number}\index{rational numbers} can be written as $\dfrac{a}{b}$ where $a\in\Z$, $b\in\Z$, and $b\ne 0$.
\end{definition}

In other words, rational numbers can be written as a fraction of integers, where the denominator is nonzero.
\begin{warning}
Note the words ``can be'' in the definition.  Rational numbers do not have to be represented as fractions.  And fractions are not necessarily rational numbers.  
\end{warning}

\begin{question}
Which of the following numbers are rational?
$$\frac{5}{4}, \qquad 718, \qquad \sqrt{2}, \qquad 2.718, \qquad \frac{22}{7}, \qquad \frac{12}{4}, \qquad \frac{\pi}{3}, \qquad \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{8}}, \qquad \frac{1}{43}$$
\end{question}

The set of all \textbf{rational numbers} is denoted by the symbol $\Q$: 
\[
      \Q = \left\{\frac{a}{b}\text{ such that $a\in\Z$ and $b\in\Z$ with $b\ne 0$}\right\}\index{Q@$\Q$}\index{e@$\in$}
\]
The letter $\Q$ stands for the word \textit{quotient}, which should remind us of
fractions.   The funny little ``$\in$'' symbol means ``is in'' or ``is an element of.'' Fancy folks will replace the words \textit{such that} with a colon
``:'' to get:
\[
 \Q = \left\{\frac{a}{b}:\text{$a\in\Z$ and $b\in\Z$ with $b\ne 0$}\right\}
\]


\subsection{Why do People Hate Fractions?}

Why do so many people find fractions difficult? This is a question
worth exploring. We'll guide you through some of the tough spots with
some questions of our own.

\[
\frac{a'/b'}{c'} \neq \frac{a'}{b'/c'}

\section{Decimal Representations}

There are two ways that we usually write real numbers that aren't whole numbers:  as fractions and as decimals.  Let's explore the relationship between these two representations of numbers.  

\begin{activitynote}
Activities \ref{A:hundredthsGrids}, \ref{A:Shampoo}, and \ref{A:DecNotNice} are intended for this section.

\begin{question} How is a ``fraction'' different from a rational number?  
\end{question}
\QM

First, let's work on translating fraction representations into decimal representations.  You probably already know from school that some numbers have decimal representations that end (these are called ``terminating'' decimals) and the rest of them have decimal representations that never end (these are ``non-terminating'').  Try to figure out what it would take for a fraction to have a terminating decimal representation.  

\begin{question}
Write $.465$, $0.72895$, $0.00673$, and $34.062$ as fractions of integers.  What do you notice about terminating decimals when they are written as fractions?  
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Write $4/5$, $7/16$, $43/20$, and $3/6250$ as decimals.   What about these fractions makes the decimals terminate?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Your calculator is not trustworthy for determining whether a number's decimal representation terminates or repeats.  Why?  How can you use your calculator carefully to judge whether a decimal terminates or repeats?  
\end{question}
\QM

In Activity \ref{A:Shampoo}, you separate a bunch of fractions according to whether they appear to have a terminating or non-terminating decimals.  The rational numbers that have a terminating decimals are straighforward to describe, once you see the idea.  The real action (and the intrigue) lies with the non-terminating ones.  

Let's investigate with a fraction that has a non-terminating representation:  4/7.  As you know, 4/7 is the same as ``4 divided by 7.''  So, use long division to find the decimal representation.\standard{7.NS.2d}Bring a pillow, because you already know that it will take an infinite number of steps to complete the work!

Now that you've spent your life doing long division, can you carefully explain why the fraction's non-terminating representation will ``repeat''?  (Hint:  Think about remainders.)  Try a few others, like 2/13, 3/11, or 4/17.  Will the same sort of thing happen with, say, 3457/213678940753?  What can you say about how soon the process will repeat?  

Here are some cool things you can investigate on the side:
\begin{itemize}
\item Some non-terminating decimals have a ``delay'' before they start repeating.  (The most famous one is probably $1/6$.)  I happen to know 1/123750000 will have a delay of 7 places before the repeating starts.  Can you look at a fraction and predict whether it will or will not have a delay (and how long that delay will be)?   
\item What are the restrictions to the sizes of the ``blocks'' for the repeating decimal representation of a rational number?  For example, any fraction with denominator 37 can only possibly repeat in blocks of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, or 36.
\end{itemize}

Based on the ideas you have explored, you can prove that a non-terminating decimal representation of a rational number must repeat.  Is the converse true?  Can any repeating decimal be written as a fraction?  It turns out indeed to be the case, as can be found by taking advantage of a nice pattern involving the decimals representations of 1/9, 1/99, 1/999, etc., or by noting that each repeating decimal is a ``geometric series,'' as we will explore later.  

Thus, we have it that every rational number can be written as either a terminating or repeating decimal.\standard{8.NS.1}  Can every decimal be written as a fraction?  That is, we have that all fractions are decimals, but are all decimals fractions?  Have we let any decimals out in the cold here?

\begin{question} Describe the decimal representations of 3 ``homemade'' decimals that could never be written as fractions of integers.  Explain your thinking.  Warning:  Do \emph{not} say  $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, $e$, or the like, unless you are ready to convince the class that these are not rational numbers.
\end{question}

\subsection{A Note on Infinite Processes}
Mathematical reasoning often involves ``infinite processes'' in which direct calculation is impossible.\margincomment{This discussion draws heavily on ideas described in \emph{Where Mathematics Comes  From: How the embodied mind brings mathematics into being}  by Lakoff and N\'{u}\~{n}ez (2000).}  Infinite processes become central in calculus, where both differentiation and integration are defined via limits.  These approaches are made rigorous in advanced undergraduate courses, such as Real Analysis.  But infinite processes arise from time to time even in middle grades mathematics, and so it is important that teachers are able to talk about them sensibly and accurately.  Here we explain some key ideas for reasoning about infinite processes.  

First, there is the idea of a process that continues, over and over, without end.  
Here are some examples:
\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item Perhaps the earliest of these is counting: 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots.  We do not imagine completing the process of counting.  Nonetheless, for any large positive number you name, we can imagine exceeding that number, eventually, if we have enough time.  
\item We can approximate $1/3$ with a sequence, $0.3$, $0.33$, $0.333$, and so on.  We can get as close to $1/3$ as we like by including enough digits.  Note, on the other hand, that it is false to say that $0.3333 = 1/3$ or even $0.3333333333 = 1/3$, because any finite number of digits will miss $1/3$ by an amount that can be calculated precisely.  
\item If we look at a sequence of regular $n$-gons of the same diameter, as $n$ gets large, we can get as close to a circle as we might like.  But for any finite number of sides, the regular $n$-gon will not actually be a circle.  
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

The above examples use what is sometimes called \emph{potential infinity}, for in none of the cases do we actually complete the process, and we do not need to.  We imagine these things as going on ``forever,'' and a process that goes on forever never ends.  

But the interesting uses of infinity in mathematics involve \emph{actual infinity}.  
\begin{question}
In each of the above examples, what would happen if the process could end?
\end{question}
\QM

In order to conceptualize actual infinity, we imagine, metaphorically, that the process \emph{does} end.  In a literal sense, an infinite process cannot end, but through the use of metaphor, we consider what would happen if the process were to end.  And with the help of intuitions about completed processes, we then infer the ``ultimate result'' of the completed infinite process.    

With the metaphor of actual infinity, counting yields the infinite set of counting numbers, $\N$.  All of them.  In the repeating decimal for $1/3$, we get an exact decimal representation, so that $0.33333\ldots = 1/3$.  Exactly.  And in the case of the regular $n$-gon with an infinite number of sides, we get a circle.  Perfectly.  

\begin{warning}
With the metaphor of actual infinity, it is \emph{false} to say that $0.3333\ldots$ never gets to $1/3$ because the dots imply that the infinite process has been completed.  Although any finite number of digits fails reach $1/3$, an infinite number of digits reaches $1/3$ exactly:  The error has gone to 0.  
\end{warning}

In summary, reasoning about infinite processes involves the following steps:  
\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describing the finite process carefully and accurately;
\item Considering the process to go on forever, and describing how the result can get arbitrarily close to some goal;
\item Imagining that the infinite process has been completed; and
\item Reasoning about the ``ultimate result'' of the infinite process.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

For some infinite processes, it is quite helpful in the second and fourth steps to talk about the ``error,'' which is to say how much the finite process falls short of the ultimate goal, and then to argue that the error becomes arbitrarily small (i.e., it goes to 0).

\item You should know or be able to figure out (in your head) decimal equivalents of fractions with many small  or ``nice'' denominators (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 40, and 50).  Describe how to figure out quickly any that you might forget.  

\item Here is a nice relationship between twelfths and eighths:  $1/8\approx 0.12$ and $1/12\approx 0.08$.  Find other such pairs, and explain why the pairs ``work'' this way.   

\item Compare the decimal representations of $\frac{1}{7}$, $\frac{2}{7}$, $\frac{3}{7}$, $\frac{4}{7}$, $\frac{5}{7}$, and  $\frac{6}{7}$.

\item $\dfrac{11}{70}$

\subsection*{Generalizations}
\item Use long division to explain why the decimal representation of a rational number must either terminate or repeat.

\item Suppose $\frac{m}{n}$ is a rational number in lowest terms.  If the number's decimal representation terminates, what can you conclude about $m$ and about $n$?  Explain.  

\item Suppose $\frac{m}{n}$ is a rational number in lowest terms.  If you know the number's decimal representation repeats, what can you conclude about the number of repeating digits?  Explain.  

\item You have seen three types of decimal representations for rational numbers between 0 and 1:  terminating, repeating, and delayed-repeating.  Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are counting numbers with no common factors and $m<n$.  Explain why the type of decimal representation of $\frac{m}{n}$ depends only on $n$ and not on $m$.  Hint:  Consider the three types separately.  

\subsection*{Explorations}

\item The rational number $\frac{1}{19}$ has decimal representation $0.\overline{052631578947368421}$.  To verify this, your calculator is unlikely to display enough digits, and long division would be quite tedious.  Devise a method for ``piecing together'' this decimal representation in ``chunks,'' using your calculator.  Then use the method to compute the decimal representation of $\frac{7}{23}$.  Be sure to indicate how you know that it repeats as you claim.  

\item Given a prime number $p$, find the smallest positive integer $n$ so that $p$ divides $10^n-1$, or explain why there is no such integer $n$.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do this for all primes less than 15, and also for the primes 37, 41, 73, and 101.
\item For each prime, compare the $n$ you found with the number of repeating digits in the decimal representation of $\frac{1}{p}$.  
Make a conjecture about what you notice.  Provide a brief explanation of why your conjecture ought to be true. 
\end{enumerate}

% In the following two problems, keep in mind that you are trying to explain arithmetic of decimals, which you will teach in grade 5.  
% So your explanations should NOT USE arithmetic of decimals.  Use fractions and the meanings of 
% decimals instead.  And it would be better if you do not use %negative exponents, which is in grade 8.

\item Explain the algorithm for multiplication of decimals in \textbf{two different ways} using $2.7\times 3.4$ as an example.  Be sure your explanations address two key questions:  (i) Why can you almost ignore the decimal point and multiply as though the digits described whole numbers?  And (ii) How do you know where to place the decimal point in the result?  Here are some ideas:  
\begin{itemize}
\item Use behind the scenes algebra to explain why the digits in the  $27\times 34$ should be the same as the digits in the desired product $2.7\times 3.4$.  
\item Convert the decimals to fractions, compute the product of the fractions, and then convert the result to a decimal.  
\item Use the picture below to compute $2.7\times 3.4$ with neither an algorithm nor a calculator.  Explain your reasoning.  
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.8]
%\draw [line width=0.1pt,gray!30,step=1mm] (0,0) grid (3.4,2.7);
%\draw [help lines] (0,0) grid (3.4,2.7);

\item Explain why the above picture can also represent $27\times 34$.  Explain the lengths and areas for both calculations.  

\end{itemize}

\item Explain the algorithm for division of decimals in \textbf{two different ways} using $3.96\div 2.4$ as an example.  Be sure your explanations address two key questions:  (i) Why can you almost ignore the decimal point and divide as though the digits described whole numbers?  And (ii) How do you know where to place the decimal point in the result?  Here are some ideas:  
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the measurement model of division to reason how many groups of size $2.4$ are in $3.96$.
\item Use bundles or base ten blocks where the single stick or unit block represents a quantity other than 1.  
\item Multiply both the dividend and the divisor by a suitable power of 10 and then divide.  
\item Convert both decimals to fractions, divide the fractions, then convert the result back to a decimal.  
\item Divide $396$ by $24$ and then use estimation to place the decimal point.
