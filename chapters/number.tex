\section{The Integers}

In this course we will discuss several different sets of numbers. The
first set we encounter is called the \textit{integers}.

\begin{definition}\index{integers}\index{Z@$\Z$}
The set of whole numbers, zero, and negative whole numbers is called
the set of \textbf{integers}. We use the symbol $\Z$ to denote the
integers:
\[
\Z = \{\dots, -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots \}
\]
\end{definition}

In case you're wondering, the symbol $\Z$ is used because
\textit{Zahlen} is the German word for ``numbers.'' 


\subsection{Addition}

Addition is probably the first operation we learn. 

\begin{question}
Write a story problem whose solution is given by the expression
$19+17$. Let this context be a ``working'' model for addition.
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Does your model show associativity of addition? If so, explain how. If
not, can you come up with a new model (story problem) that does?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Does your model show commutativity of addition? If so, explain how. If
not, can you come up with a new model that does?
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{question}
Does your model work with negative integers, that is does it model say
$19+ (-17)$? If so, explain how. If not, can you come up with a new
model that does?
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{question}
We know that 
\[
a - b  = a + (-b),
\]
but I insist that the left-hand side of the equation is conceptually
different from the right-hand side of the equation. Write two story
problems, one solved by $19-17$ and the other solved by
$19+(-17)$. What's the difference? (Pun intended!)
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
Here we are trying to have the students develop the ``take-away,''
along with the ``missing addend,'' and a ``comparison'' model for
subtraction.
\end{teachingnote}


\begin{question}
Can you use the two story problems above to model
\[
(-19)-17, \qquad  19 - (-17), \qquad (-19) - (-17)?
\]
\end{question}
\QM

\subsection{Multiplication}


Multiplication is more multifaceted than addition. 

\begin{question}
Write a story problem whose solution is given by the expression
$19\cdot 17$. Let this context be a ``working'' model for multiplication. 
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
We would like to point out that the units used in addition are generally
the same for the different summands. However, with multiplication, the
different factors often have different units.
\end{teachingnote}



\begin{teachingnote}
The next question is with Problem~\ref{P:MA} of
Section~\ref{S:aritmetic} in mind. In particular to show
associativity, we suggest appealing to the notion of volume.
\end{teachingnote}

\begin{question}
Does your model show associativity of multiplication? If so, explain
how. If not, can you come up with a new model that does?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Does your model show commutativity of multiplication? If so, explain
how. If not, can you come up with a new model that does?
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{question}
Does your model work with negative integers? In particular does your
model show that
\[
\text{positive}\cdot \text{negative} = \text{negative},
\]
\[
\text{negative}\cdot \text{positive} = \text{negative},
\]
and 
\[
\text{negative}\cdot \text{negative} = \text{positive}?
\]
If so, explain how. If not, can you come up with a new model that
does?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
This is difficult. The students may not be able to come up with a
model that works. This is OK---as this issue is addressed in
Problem~\ref{P:NNP}.
\end{teachingnote}


\subsection{Division} 

While addition and multiplication are good operations, the real
``meat'' of the situation comes with division.


\begin{definition}\index{divides}    %\index{dn@$d "| n$} %% the pipe breaks stuff
We say that an integer $d$ \textbf{divides} an integer $n$ if there is
an integer $q$
\[
n = dq
\]
in this case we write $d | n$, which is said: ``$d$ divides $n$.'' 
\end{definition}

While this may seem easy, it is actually quite tricky. You must always
remember the following synonyms for \textit{divides}:
\[\index{multiple}\index{factor}
\text{``$d$ \textbf{divides} $n$''}\leftrightsquigarrow \text{``$d$ is
  a \textbf{factor} of $n$''}\leftrightsquigarrow \text{``$n$ is a
  \textbf{multiple} of $d$''}
\]


\begin{activitynote}
Activity \ref{A:dm} complements this section well.  % What Can Division Mean
\end{activitynote}



\begin{definition}\index{prime number} 
A \textbf{prime} number is a positive integer with exactly two
positive divisors, namely $1$ and itself.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\index{composite number} 
A \textbf{composite} number is a positive integer with more than two
positive divisors.
\end{definition}

I claim that every composite number is divisible by a prime number. Do
you believe me? If not, consider this:
\begin{quote}
Suppose there was a composite number that was \textit{not} divisible
by a prime. Then there would necessarily be a \textit{smallest}
composite number that is not divisible by a prime. Since this number
is composite, this number is the product of two even smaller numbers,
both of which have prime divisors. Hence our original number must have
prime divisors.
\end{quote}
\begin{question} 
What the heck just happened?! Can you rewrite the above paragraph,
drawing pictures and/or using symbols as necessary, making it more
clear?
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{activitynote}
Activity \ref{A:Pr} complements this section well.  %  There's Always Another Prime
\end{activitynote}


\subsection{Factoring}

At this point we can factor any composite completely into primes. To
do this, it is often convenient to make a \textit{factor
  tree}:\index{factor tree}

\[
\xymatrix@R=0pt@C=10pt{
  & 360 \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] & & & & &\\
2 &     & 180 \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] & & & & \\ 
  &  2   &     & 90 \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] & & & \\
  &      &  2  &    & 45  \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] & & \\ 
  &      &     & 5  &    & 9 \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] &\\ 
  &      &     &    &  3  &  & 3
}
\]

From this tree\footnote{Why is this a tree? It looks more like roots to me!} we see that
\[
360 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5.
\]

At each step we simply divided by whichever prime number seemed most
obvious, branched off the tree and kept on going. From our factor
tree, we can see some of the divisors of the integer in
question. However, there are many composite factors that can be built
up from the prime divisors. One of the most important is the
\textit{greatest common divisor}.

\begin{definition}\index{GCD}\index{greatest common divisor} 
The \textbf{greatest common divisor} (GCD) of two numbers $a$ and $b$
is a number $g = \gcd(a,b)$ where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g|a$ and $g|b$.
\item If $d|a$ and $d|b$, then $d \le g$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{question}
How do you use a factor tree to compute the GCD of two integers?
\end{question}
\QM



So, to factor an integer or find the GCD, one could use a factor
tree. However, when building the factor tree, we had to know what
primes to divide by. What if no prime comes to mind? What if you want
to factor the integer $391$ or $397$? This raises a new question:

\begin{question} 
How do you check to see if a given integer is prime? What possible
divisors must you check? When can you stop checking?
\end{question}
\QM


\begin{activitynote}
Activity \ref{A:Sie} complements this section well. % Sieving It All Out
\end{activitynote}


%\begin{question}
%How should you identify all the primes between $1$ and $100$? Big
%hint: Maybe you should either go to the shoe store, or read up on
%Eratosthenes.\index{Eratosthenes}
%\end{question}
%\QM







\subsection{Division with Remainder}


We all remember long division\index{long division}, or at least we
remember \textit{doing} long division. Sometimes, we need to be
reminded of our \textit{forgotten foes}\index{forgotten foes}. When
aloof old Professor Rufus was trying to explain division to his class,
he merely wrote
\[
d\,\begin{tabular}[b]{@{}r@{} r}
$q$ &\, R\,$r$\\ \cline{1-1}
\big)\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}
$n$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{tabular}
\qquad\text{where}\qquad
\begin{tabular}{l}
$d$ is the divisor \\ \index{divisor}
$n$ is the dividend \\ \index{dividend}
$q$ is the quotient \\ \index{quotient}
$r$ is the remainder \index{remainder}
\end{tabular}
\]
and walked out of the room.

\begin{question} 
Can you give $3$ much needed examples of long division with
remainders?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question} 
Given positive integers $d$, $n$, $q$, and $r$ how do you know if they
leave us with a correct expression above?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question} 
Given positive integers $d$ and $n$, how many different sets of $q$
and $r$ can you find that will leave us with a correct expression
above?
\end{question}
\QM


The innocuous questions above can be turned into a theorem. We'll start
it for you, but you must finish it off yourself:

\begin{theorem}[Division Theorem]\index{Division Theorem!for integers}
Given any integer $n$ and a nonzero integer $d$, there exist unique
integers $q$ and $r$ such that
\vspace{1in}
\end{theorem}
\noindent The above space has intentionally been left blank for you to
fill in.


\begin{teachingnote}
Here we want the students to realize that
\[
n = dq + r\qquad\text{where } 0 \le r < d 
\]
\end{teachingnote}


Now consider the following picture:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/divisionThmProof.pdf}
\]
\begin{question} 
How does the picture above ``prove'' the Division Theorem for positive
integers? How must we change the picture if we allow negative values
for $n$ and $d$?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{teachingnote}
The second part of this question might be too hard for most students.
\end{teachingnote}

\section{The Euclidean Algorithm}\index{Euclidean algorithm}\label{S:EA}


Up to this point, computing the GCD of two integers required you to
factor both numbers.  This can be difficult to do. The following
algorithm, called the \textit{Euclidean algorithm}, makes finding
GCD's quite easy. With that said, algorithms can be tricky to
explain. Let's try this---study the following calculations, they are
examples of the Euclidean algorithm in action:
\begin{align*}
22 &= \boldsymbol{6}\cdot 3 + \boldsymbol{4}\\ 
\boldsymbol{6} &= \boldsymbol{4}
\cdot 1 + \fbox{$\boldsymbol{2}$}\\ 4 &= 2 \cdot 2 + 0 \qquad 
\fbox{$\therefore \gcd(22,6) = 2$}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
33 &= \boldsymbol{24}\cdot 1 + \boldsymbol{9}\\
\boldsymbol{24} &= \boldsymbol{9} \cdot 2 + \boldsymbol{6}\\
\boldsymbol{9} &= \boldsymbol{6} \cdot 1 + \fbox{$\boldsymbol{3}$}\\
6 &= 3 \cdot 2 + 0 \qquad \fbox{$\therefore \gcd(33,24) = 3$} 
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
42 &= \boldsymbol{16}\cdot 2 + \boldsymbol{10}\\
\boldsymbol{16} &= \boldsymbol{10} \cdot 1 + \boldsymbol{6}\\
\boldsymbol{10} &= \boldsymbol{6} \cdot 1 + \boldsymbol{4}\\
\boldsymbol{6} &= \boldsymbol{4} \cdot 1 + \fbox{$\boldsymbol{2}$}\\
4 &= 2 \cdot 2 + 0 \qquad \fbox{$\therefore \gcd(42,16) = 2$} 
\end{align*}

\begin{question}
Can you describe how to do the Euclidean algorithm?
\end{question}
\QM

\begin{question}
Can you explain why the Euclidean algorithm will always stop? Hint:
Division Theorem.
\end{question}

\begin{activitynote}
Activity \ref{A:GCDwork} complements this section well.  % Why Does It Work? 
\end{activitynote}


The algorithm demonstrated above is called the \textit{Euclidean
  algorithm} or \textit{Euclid's algorithm} because
Euclid\index{Euclid} uses it several times in Books VII and X of his
book \textit{The Elements}. Donald Knuth\index{Knuth} gives a
description of the Euclidean algorithm in the first volume of his
series of books \textit{The Art of Computer Programming}. Given
integers $m$ and $n$, he describes it as follows:
\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item\label{A:E1} [Find remainder.] Divide $m$ by $n$ and let $r$ be the remainder. (We will have $0\le r< n$.)
\item{[Is it zero?]} If $r=0$, the algorithm terminates; $n$ is the answer.
\item{[Interchange.]} Set $m \leftarrow n$, $n \leftarrow r$, and go
  back to step \ref{A:E1}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{question}
What do you think of this description? How does it compare to your
description of the Euclidean algorithm?
\end{question}
\QM

While the Euclidean algorithm is handy and fun, its real power is that
it helps us solve equations. Specifically it helps us solve
\textit{linear Diophantine equations}.

\begin{definition}\index{Diophantine equation}
A \textbf{Diophantine equation} is an equation where only integer
solutions are deemed acceptable.
\end{definition}

We're going to solve \textit{linear Diophantine equations}, that is, equations of the form:
\[
ax + by = c
\]
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers and the only solutions we will
accept are also integers. Let's study the following calculations:

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\begin{minipage}{15em}
{\begin{align*}
22 &= 6\cdot 3 + 4 &\Leftrightarrow & &  22-6\cdot 3 &= \boldsymbol{4}\\ 
6 &= 4\cdot 1 + 2 &\Leftrightarrow  & &  6 - \boldsymbol{4}\cdot 1 &= 2\\ 
4 &= 2 \cdot 2 + 0 
\end{align*}}
\end{minipage}
&
\begin{minipage}{15em}
{\begin{align*}
6 - 4\cdot 1 &= 2 \\
6 - (22-6\cdot 3)\cdot 1 &= 2 \\
6\cdot 4 + 22(-1) &= 2 
\end{align*}}
\end{minipage} \\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\fbox{$\therefore 22x + 6y =2$ where $x = -1$ and $y = 4$}}
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{lr}
\begin{minipage}{15em}
{\begin{align*}
33 &= 24\cdot 1 + 9 & \Leftrightarrow & & 33 - 24\cdot 1 &= \boldsymbol{9}\\
24 &= 9 \cdot 2 + 6 & \Leftrightarrow & & 24 - \boldsymbol{9}\cdot 2 &= \boldsymbol{6}\\
9 &= 6 \cdot 1 + 3 & \Leftrightarrow & & 9 - \boldsymbol{6} \cdot 1  &= 3\\
6 &= 3 \cdot 2 + 0  
\end{align*}}
\end{minipage}
&
\begin{minipage}{15em}
{\begin{align*}
9 - 6 \cdot 1  &= 3 \\
9 - (24 - 9\cdot 2) \cdot 1  &= 3 \\
9\cdot 3 +  24\cdot(-1)  &= 3 \\
(33 - 24\cdot 1)\cdot 3 +  24\cdot(-1)  &= 3 \\
33\cdot 3 + 24\cdot (-4) &=3

\subsection{Fundamental Theorems}



\begin{teachingnote}
An important point of this section is to make the student think about
the distributive property. One should try to point out each time
\[
a(x+y) = ax + ay
\]
occurs.
\end{teachingnote}

The Euclidean algorithm is also useful for theoretical
questions.

\begin{question} 
Given integers $a$ and $b$, what is the smallest positive integer that
can be expressed as
\[
ax + by
\]
where $x$ and $y$ are also integers?
\end{question}

I'm feeling chatty, so I'll take this one. I claim that $g =
\gcd(a,b)$ is the smallest positive integer that can be
expressed as
\[
ax + by
\]
where $x$ and $y$ are integers. How do I know? Well, suppose there was
a smaller positive integer, say $s$ where:
\[
ax + by = s
\]
Hmmm\dots but we know that $g|a$ and $g|b$. This means that $g$
divides the left-hand-side of the equation. This means that $g$
divides the right-hand-side of the equation. So $g|s$---but this is
impossible, as $s< g$. Thus $g$ is the smallest integer that can be
expressed as $ax +by$.


Believe it or not, we're going somewhere with all this. The next
\textit{lemma}\index{lemma} will help us out.  What is a lemma, you
ask? A lemma is nothing but a little theorem that helps us solve
another problem. Note that a lemma should not be confused with the
more sour \index{lemon|see{lemma}}\textit{lemon}, as that is something
different and unrelated to what we are discussing.

\begin{lemma}[Euclid's Lemma]\index{Euclid's Lemma} 
If $p$ is a prime number and $a$ and $b$ are integers
\[
p|ab \qquad\text{implies that} \qquad p | a\text{ or } p|b.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{question} Can you use the ideas above to explain why this lemma is true?
\end{question}

\begin{question} If $11 | 50a$, is it true that $11|a$?

Now we have set the stage for our fundamental theorem---it is
sometimes called the \textit{Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic}:


\begin{theorem}[Unique Factorization]\index{Unique Factorization Theorem}\index{Fundamental Theorem!of Arithmetic}
Every integer greater than 1 can be factored uniquely (up to ordering)
into primes.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Well, if an integer is prime, we are done. If an integer is composite,
then it is divisible by a prime number. Divide and repeat with the
quotient. If our original integer was $n$, we'll eventually get:
\[
n = p_1p_2 \cdots p_m
\]
where some of the $p_i$'s may be duplicates. 

How do we know this factorization is unique? Well, suppose that
\[
n = p_1p_2 \cdots p_m = q_1q_2\cdots q_l
\]
where the $p_i$'s are all prime and none of them equal any of the
$q_j$'s which are also prime. So, $\gcd(p_1,q_1) = 1$, and by the
definition of ``divides''
\[
p_1 |q_1(q_2\cdots q_l).
\]
So by Euclid's Lemma, $p_1$ must divide $(q_2\cdots q_l)$. Repeat this
enough times and you will find that $p_1 = q_j$ for one of the $q_j$'s
above. Repeat this process for the $p_i$'s and you see that the
factorization is unique.
\end{proof}

\section{Rational Numbers}


Once you are familiar with integers, you start to notice something:
Given an integer, it may or may not divide into another integer
evenly. This property is at the heart of our notions of factoring and
primality. Life would be very different if all nonzero integers
divided evenly into one another. With this in mind, we introduce
\textit{rational numbers}.

\begin{definition} 
A \textbf{rational number}\index{rational numbers} is a fraction of
integers, where the denominator is nonzero.
\end{definition}

The set of all rational numbers is denoted by the symbol $\Q$:
\[
      \Q = \left\{\frac{a}{b}\text{ such that $a\in\Z$ and $b\in\Z$ with $b\ne 0$}\right\}\index{Q@$\Q$}\index{e@$\in$}
\]
The funny little ``$\in$'' symbol means ``is in'' or ``is an element of.'' Fancy folks will replace the words \textit{such that} with a colon
``:'' to get:
\[
 \Q = \left\{\frac{a}{b}:\text{$a\in\Z$ and $b\in\Z$ with $b\ne 0$}\right\}
\]
We call this set the \textbf{rational numbers}.  The letter $\Q$
stands for the word \textit{quotient}, which should remind us of
fractions.

\item Three drops of \textit{Monica's XXX Hot Sauce} were mixed with
  five cups of chili mix to make a spicy treat---the hot sauce is much
  hotter than the chili. Later, two drops of \textit{Monica's XXX Hot
    Sauce} were mixed with three cups of chili. Which mixture is
  hotter? Josh suggested the following method to compare the
  concentrations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Remove the second (recipe) from the first, that is: Start with 3
  drops of hot sauce and 5 cups of chili, and remove 2 drops and 3
  cups. So we are now comparing
\[
\text{1 drop and 2 cups}\qquad\text{with}\qquad\text{2 drops and 3 cups.}
\]
\item Now remove the first from the second, that is: Start with 2
  drops and 3 cups, and remove 1 drop and 2 cups. So we are now
  comparing
\[
\text{1 drop and 2 cups}\qquad\text{with}\qquad\text{1 drop and 1
  cup.}
\]
\end{itemize}
Now you can see that the second is more concentrated (and hence
hotter!) than the first. Is this correct? Will this strategy
always/ever work? Explain your reasoning.
\item Let $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ be positive integers such that 
\[
a<b<c<d

  integers such that
\[
a<b<c<d.
\]
Is it true that

\frac{a}{b}<\frac{b}{c}<\frac{c}{d}?
\]
Explain your reasoning.

  above? Explain your reasoning.
